title: DUALSCALE DIFFUSION: ADAPTIVE FEATURE BAL- ANCING FOR LOW-DIMENSIONAL GENERATIVE MOD- ELS
abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for low- dimensional diffusion models, addressing the challenge of balancing global struc- ture and local detail in generated samples. While diffusion models have shown re- markable success in high-dimensional spaces, their application to low-dimensional data remains crucial for understanding fundamental model behaviors and address- ing real-world applications with inherently low-dimensional data. However, in these spaces, traditional models often struggle to simultaneously capture both macro-level patterns and fine-grained features, leading to suboptimal sample qual- ity. We propose a novel architecture incorporating two parallel branches: a global branch processing the original input and a local branch handling an upscaled ver- sion, with a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism dynamically balancing their contributions. We evaluate our method on four diverse 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in sample quality, with KL divergence reductions of up to 12.8% compared to the baseline model. The adaptive weighting successfully adjusts the focus be- tween global and local features across different datasets and denoising stages, as evidenced by our weight evolution analysis. This work not only enhances low-dimensional diffusion models but also provides insights that could inform improvements in higher-dimensional domains, opening new avenues for advancing generative modeling across various applications.
