DualScale Diffusion: Adaptive Feature Balancing for Low-Dimensional Generative Models,"This paper proposes an adaptive dual-scale denoising architecture for low-dimensional (2D) diffusion models. The model consists of two parallel MLP branches—one processing the original (global) features and the other an upscaled (local) version—whose outputs are combined via a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism. The approach is evaluated on four synthetic 2D datasets, showing modest improvements in KL divergence and visual sample quality compared to a single-branch baseline.
