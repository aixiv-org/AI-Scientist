StyleFusion: Adaptive Multi-style Generation in Character-Level Language Models,"This paper proposes the Multi-Style Adapter, an architectural extension to transformer-based character-level language models (specifically GPT) to enable style-aware and style-consistent text generation. The method introduces learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and adapter modules after each transformer layer to modulate hidden states based on inferred style. Experiments are conducted on shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8 datasets, reporting minor improvements in validation loss and high 'style consistency' as measured by a classifier, but with a significant reduction in inference speed.","[""How are 'styles' defined and labeled for each dataset, especially for enwik8 and text8? Are these datasets actually multi-style, or are styles artificially imposed?"", 'How is the style consistency metric computed? How is the classifier trained, and what are its accuracy and reliability? Is it robust to non-synthetic, real-world texts?', ""Can you provide qualitative examples of generated text for different styles to demonstrate the model's control and diversity?"", 'Why are strong baselines (e.g., CTRL, AdapterFusion, style-token methods) not included in the experimental comparison?', 'Does the model generalize to unseen styles or only to those seen during training?', 'Are there any human studies or external validation of the claimed stylistic control?', 'What do the learned style embeddings correspond to? Are they interpretable?', 'What is the practical implication of the reduction in inference speed? Is the approach scalable to larger models and datasets?']","['The main limitation is the absence of a rigorous definition and labeling of style, making the experimental claims unverifiable.', 'The evaluation of style consistency is unclear and potentially tautological.', 'No qualitative or human evaluation is provided.', 'No comparison to strong style-control baselines.', 'Significant computational cost for modest or ambiguous gains.', 'Possible overfitting or lack of diversity in generated outputs.', 'Limited applicability beyond character-level models.', 'No discussion of potential negative societal impacts or ethical concerns.']",False,2,3,2,2,4,"['Addresses the relevant and practical problem of stylistic control in language generation.', 'The proposed method is modular, simple, and compatible with existing transformer architectures.', 'The paper is generally clearly written and includes ablation studies and quantitative results.', 'Implementation details are provided, and the approach is easy to integrate into existing models.']","[""The definition and operationalization of 'style' are not specified, especially for enwik8 and text8; it is unclear how styles are defined, labeled, or distinguished, making experimental claims unverifiable."", 'The style consistency metric relies on a classifier trained on synthetic data, but the construction, validation, and reliability of this classifier are not described, raising concerns about tautological or trivial results.', 'No qualitative analysis or human evaluation is provided to demonstrate that the model produces genuinely stylistic or diverse outputs.', 'Improvements in validation loss are marginal or negative (e.g., on shakespeare_char), while inference speed is significantly reduced (~40% slower).', 'No comparison is made to strong, relevant baselines from the style control literature (e.g., CTRL, AdapterFusion, style-token methods).', 'Technical novelty is limited; the approach is an incremental combination of existing ideas (adapters, style embeddings, classifiers).', 'No evidence is provided for generalization to unseen styles, diversity within styles, or practical value in downstream tasks.', 'Ethical and societal impacts of style manipulation are not discussed.', 'Crucial experimental and methodological details are omitted, making the work difficult to evaluate or reproduce.']",2,2,3,2,Reject
