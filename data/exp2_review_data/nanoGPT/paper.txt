title: STYLEFUSION: ADAPTIVE MULTI-STYLE GENERATION IN CHARACTER-LEVEL LANGUAGE MODELS
abstract: This paper introduces the Multi-Style Adapter, a novel approach to enhance style awareness and consistency in character-level language models. As language models advance, the ability to generate text in diverse and consistent styles becomes crucial for applications ranging from creative writing assistance to personalized content generation. However, maintaining style consistency while preserving language generation capabilities presents a significant challenge. Our Multi-Style Adapter addresses this by introducing learnable style embeddings and a style classification head, working in tandem with a StyleAdapter module to modulate the hidden states of a transformer-based language model. We implement this approach by modifying the GPT architecture, incorporating style adaptation after every transformer layer to create stronger style-specific representations. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including Shakespeareâ€™s works (shakespeare_char), enwik8, and text8, we demonstrate that our approach achieves high style consistency while maintaining competitive language modeling performance. Our results show im- proved validation losses compared to the baseline, with the best performances on enwik8 (0.9488) and text8 (0.9145). Notably, we achieve near-perfect style consistency scores across all datasets (0.9667 for shakespeare_char, 1.0 for enwik8 and text8). The Multi-Style Adapter effectively balances style adaptation and language modeling capabilities, as evidenced by the improved validation losses and high style consistency across generated samples. However, this comes at a cost of increased computational complexity, resulting in slower inference speeds (approximately 400 tokens per second compared to 670 in the baseline). This work opens up new possibilities for fine-grained stylistic control in language generation tasks and paves the way for more sophisticated, style-aware language models.
