While sharp convergence guarantees have been established for the DDPM, the iteration complexity is, in general, proportional to the ambient data dimension, resulting in overly conservative theory that fails to explain its practical efficiency. This has motivated the recent work Li and Yan (2024a) to investigate how the DDPM can achieve sampling speed-ups through automatic exploitation of intrinsic low dimensionality of data. We strengthen this line of work by demonstrating, in some sense, optimal adaptivity to unknown low dimensionality. For a broad class of data distributions with intrinsic dimension $k$, we prove that the iteration complexity of the DDPM scales nearly linearly with $k$, which is optimal when using KL divergence to measure distributional discrepancy. Notably, our work is closely aligned with the independent concurrent work Potaptchik et al. (2024) -- posted two weeks prior to ours -- in establishing nearly linear-$k$ convergence guarantees for the DDPM.\n\ntitle: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models in Six Simple Steps\nabstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) are a very popular class of deep generative model that have been successfully applied to a diverse range of problems including image and video generation, protein and material synthesis, weather forecasting, and neural surrogates of partial differential equations. Despite their ubiquity it is hard to find an introduction to DDPMs which is simple, comprehensive, clean and clear. The compact explanations necessary in research papers are not able to elucidate all of the different design steps taken to formulate the DDPM and the rationale of the steps that are presented is often omitted to save space. Moreover, the expositions are typically presented from the variational lower bound perspective which is unnecessary and arguably harmful as it obfuscates why the method is working and suggests generalisations that do not perform well in practice. On the other hand, perspectives that take the continuous time-limit are beautiful and general, but they have a high barrier-to-entry as they require background knowledge of stochastic differential equations and probability flow. In this note, we distill down the formulation of the DDPM into six simple steps each of which comes with a clear rationale. We assume that the reader is familiar with fundamental topics in machine learning including basic probabilistic modelling, Gaussian distributions, maximum likelihood estimation, and deep learning.\n\ntitle: Adapting to Unknown Low-Dimensional Structures in Score-Based Diffusion   Models\nabstract: This paper investigates score-based diffusion models when the underlying target distribution is concentrated on or near low-dimensional manifolds within the higher-dimensional space in which they formally reside, a common characteristic of natural image distributions. Despite previous efforts to understand the data generation process of diffusion models, existing theoretical support remains highly suboptimal in the presence of low-dimensional structure, which we strengthen in this paper. For the popular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), we find that the dependency of the error incurred within each denoising step on the ambient dimension $d$ is in general unavoidable. We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner.\n\ntitle: Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces\nabstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) (Ho et al. 2020) have shown impressive results on image and waveform generation in continuous state spaces. Here, we introduce Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), diffusion-like generative models for discrete data that generalize the multinomial diffusion model of Hoogeboom et al. 2021, by going beyond corruption processes with uniform transition probabilities. This includes corruption with transition matrices that mimic Gaussian kernels in continuous space, matrices based on nearest neighbors in embedding space, and matrices that introduce absorbing states. The third allows us to draw a connection between diffusion models and autoregressive and mask-based generative models. We show that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision that leads to improved results in image and text domains. We also introduce a new loss function that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy loss. For text, this model class achieves strong results on character-level text generation while scaling to large vocabularies on LM1B. On the image dataset CIFAR-10, our models approach the sample quality and exceed the log-likelihood of the continuous-space DDPM model.\n\ntitle: Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models\nabstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) are a class of generative models which have recently been shown to produce excellent samples. We show that with a few simple modifications, DDPMs can also achieve competitive log-likelihoods while maintaining high sample quality. Additionally, we find that learning variances of the reverse diffusion process allows sampling with an order of magnitude fewer forward passes with a negligible difference in sample quality, which is important for the practical deployment of these models. We additionally use precision and recall to compare how well DDPMs and GANs cover the target distribution. Finally, we show that the sample quality and likelihood of these models scale smoothly with model capacity and training compute, making them easily scalable.

While sharp convergence guarantees have been established for the DDPM, the iteration complexity is, in general, proportional to the ambient data dimension, resulting in overly conservative theory that fails to explain its practical efficiency. This has motivated the recent work Li and Yan (2024a) to investigate how the DDPM can achieve sampling speed-ups through automatic exploitation of intrinsic low dimensionality of data. We strengthen this line of work by demonstrating, in some sense, optimal adaptivity to unknown low dimensionality. For a broad class of data distributions with intrinsic dimension $k$, we prove that the iteration complexity of the DDPM scales nearly linearly with $k$, which is optimal when using KL divergence to measure distributional discrepancy.

Despite their ubiquity it is hard to find an introduction to DDPMs which is simple, comprehensive, clean and clear. The compact explanations necessary in research papers are not able to elucidate all of the different design steps taken to formulate the DDPM and the rationale of the steps that are presented is often omitted to save space. Moreover, the expositions are typically presented from the variational lower bound perspective which is unnecessary and arguably harmful as it obfuscates why the method is working and suggests generalisations that do not perform well in practice. On the other hand, perspectives that take the continuous time-limit are beautiful and general, but they have a high barrier-to-entry as they require background knowledge of stochastic differential equations and probability flow. In this note, we distill down the formulation of the DDPM into six simple steps each of which comes with a clear rationale. We assume that the reader is familiar with fundamental topics in machine learning including basic probabilistic modelling, Gaussian distributions, maximum likelihood estimation, and deep learning.\n\ntitle: Adapting to Unknown Low-Dimensional Structures in Score-Based Diffusion   Models\nabstract: This paper investigates score-based diffusion models when the underlying target distribution is concentrated on or near low-dimensional manifolds within the higher-dimensional space in which they formally reside, a common characteristic of natural image distributions. Despite previous efforts to understand the data generation process of diffusion models, existing theoretical support remains highly suboptimal in the presence of low-dimensional structure, which we strengthen in this paper. For the popular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), we find that the dependency of the error incurred within each denoising step on the ambient dimension $d$ is in general unavoidable. We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner.\n\ntitle: Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces\nabstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) (Ho et al. 2020) have shown impressive results on image and waveform generation in continuous state spaces. Here, we introduce Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), diffusion-like generative models for discrete data that generalize the multinomial diffusion model of Hoogeboom et al. 2021, by going beyond corruption processes with uniform transition probabilities. This includes corruption with transition matrices that mimic Gaussian kernels in continuous space, matrices based on nearest neighbors in embedding space, and matrices that introduce absorbing states. The third allows us to draw a connection between diffusion models and autoregressive and mask-based generative models. We show that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision that leads to improved results in image and text domains. We also introduce a new loss function that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy loss. For text, this model class achieves strong results on character-level text generation while scaling to large vocabularies on LM1B. On the image dataset CIFAR-10, our models approach the sample quality and exceed the log-likelihood of the continuous-space DDPM model.\n\ntitle: Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models\nabstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) are a class of generative models which have recently been shown to produce excellent samples. We show that with a few simple modifications, DDPMs can also achieve competitive log-likelihoods while maintaining high sample quality. Additionally, we find that learning variances of the reverse diffusion process allows sampling with an order of magnitude fewer forward passes with a negligible difference in sample quality, which is important for the practical deployment of these models. We additionally use precision and recall to compare how well DDPMs and GANs cover the target distribution.

While sharp convergence guarantees have been established for the DDPM, the iteration complexity is, in general, proportional to the ambient data dimension, resulting in overly conservative theory that fails to explain its practical efficiency. This has motivated the recent work Li and Yan (2024a) to investigate how the DDPM can achieve sampling speed-ups through automatic exploitation of intrinsic low dimensionality of data. We strengthen this line of work by demonstrating, in some sense, optimal adaptivity to unknown low dimensionality. For a broad class of data distributions with intrinsic dimension $k$, we prove that the iteration complexity of the DDPM scales nearly linearly with $k$, which is optimal when using KL divergence to measure distributional discrepancy. Notably, our work is closely aligned with the independent concurrent work Potaptchik et al. (2024) -- posted two weeks prior to ours -- in establishing nearly linear-$k$ convergence guarantees for the DDPM.\n\ntitle: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models in Six Simple Steps\nabstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) are a very popular class of deep generative model that have been successfully applied to a diverse range of problems including image and video generation, protein and material synthesis, weather forecasting, and neural surrogates of partial differential equations. Despite their ubiquity it is hard to find an introduction to DDPMs which is simple, comprehensive, clean and clear. The compact explanations necessary in research papers are not able to elucidate all of the different design steps taken to formulate the DDPM and the rationale of the steps that are presented is often omitted to save space. Moreover, the expositions are typically presented from the variational lower bound perspective which is unnecessary and arguably harmful as it obfuscates why the method is working and suggests generalisations that do not perform well in practice. On the other hand, perspectives that take the continuous time-limit are beautiful and general, but they have a high barrier-to-entry as they require background knowledge of stochastic differential equations and probability flow. In this note, we distill down the formulation of the DDPM into six simple steps each of which comes with a clear rationale. We assume that the reader is familiar with fundamental topics in machine learning including basic probabilistic modelling, Gaussian distributions, maximum likelihood estimation, and deep learning.\n\ntitle: Adapting to Unknown Low-Dimensional Structures in Score-Based Diffusion   Models\nabstract: This paper investigates score-based diffusion models when the underlying target distribution is concentrated on or near low-dimensional manifolds within the higher-dimensional space in which they formally reside, a common characteristic of natural image distributions. Despite previous efforts to understand the data generation process of diffusion models, existing theoretical support remains highly suboptimal in the presence of low-dimensional structure, which we strengthen in this paper. For the popular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), we find that the dependency of the error incurred within each denoising step on the ambient dimension $d$ is in general unavoidable. We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner.\n\ntitle: Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces\nabstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) (Ho et al. 2020) have shown impressive results on image and waveform generation in continuous state spaces. Here, we introduce Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), diffusion-like generative models for discrete data that generalize the multinomial diffusion model of Hoogeboom et al. 2021, by going beyond corruption processes with uniform transition probabilities. This includes corruption with transition matrices that mimic Gaussian kernels in continuous space, matrices based on nearest neighbors in embedding space, and matrices that introduce absorbing states. The third allows us to draw a connection between diffusion models and autoregressive and mask-based generative models. We show that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision that leads to improved results in image and text domains. We also introduce a new loss function that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy loss. For text, this model class achieves strong results on character-level text generation while scaling to large vocabularies on LM1B. On the image dataset CIFAR-10, our models approach the sample quality and exceed the log-likelihood of the continuous-space DDPM model.\n\ntitle: Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models\nabstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) are a class of generative models which have recently been shown to produce excellent samples. We show that with a few simple modifications, DDPMs can also achieve competitive log-likelihoods while maintaining high sample quality. Additionally, we find that learning variances of the reverse diffusion process allows sampling with an order of magnitude fewer forward passes with a negligible difference in sample quality, which is important for the practical deployment of these models. We additionally use precision and recall to compare how well DDPMs and GANs cover the target distribution. Finally, we show that the sample quality and likelihood of these models scale smoothly with model capacity and training compute, making them easily scalable.

While sharp convergence guarantees have been established for the DDPM, the iteration complexity is, in general, proportional to the ambient data dimension, resulting in overly conservative theory that fails to explain its practical efficiency. This has motivated the recent work Li and Yan (2024a) to investigate how the DDPM can achieve sampling speed-ups through automatic exploitation of intrinsic low dimensionality of data. We strengthen this line of work by demonstrating, in some sense, optimal adaptivity to unknown low dimensionality. For a broad class of data distributions with intrinsic dimension $k$, we prove that the iteration complexity of the DDPM scales nearly linearly with $k$, which is optimal when using KL divergence to measure distributional discrepancy. Notably, our work is closely aligned with the independent concurrent work Potaptchik et al.

Despite their ubiquity it is hard to find an introduction to DDPMs which is simple, comprehensive, clean and clear. The compact explanations necessary in research papers are not able to elucidate all of the different design steps taken to formulate the DDPM and the rationale of the steps that are presented is often omitted to save space. Moreover, the expositions are typically presented from the variational lower bound perspective which is unnecessary and arguably harmful as it obfuscates why the method is working and suggests generalisations that do not perform well in practice. On the other hand, perspectives that take the continuous time-limit are beautiful and general, but they have a high barrier-to-entry as they require background knowledge of stochastic differential equations and probability flow. In this note, we distill down the formulation of the DDPM into six simple steps each of which comes with a clear rationale. We assume that the reader is familiar with fundamental topics in machine learning including basic probabilistic modelling, Gaussian distributions, maximum likelihood estimation, and deep learning.\n\ntitle: Adapting to Unknown Low-Dimensional Structures in Score-Based Diffusion   Models\nabstract: This paper investigates score-based diffusion models when the underlying target distribution is concentrated on or near low-dimensional manifolds within the higher-dimensional space in which they formally reside, a common characteristic of natural image distributions. Despite previous efforts to understand the data generation process of diffusion models, existing theoretical support remains highly suboptimal in the presence of low-dimensional structure, which we strengthen in this paper. For the popular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), we find that the dependency of the error incurred within each denoising step on the ambient dimension $d$ is in general unavoidable. We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner.\n\ntitle: Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces\nabstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) (Ho et al. 2020) have shown impressive results on image and waveform generation in continuous state spaces. Here, we introduce Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), diffusion-like generative models for discrete data that generalize the multinomial diffusion model of Hoogeboom et al. 2021, by going beyond corruption processes with uniform transition probabilities. This includes corruption with transition matrices that mimic Gaussian kernels in continuous space, matrices based on nearest neighbors in embedding space, and matrices that introduce absorbing states. The third allows us to draw a connection between diffusion models and autoregressive and mask-based generative models. We show that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision that leads to improved results in image and text domains. We also introduce a new loss function that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy loss. For text, this model class achieves strong results on character-level text generation while scaling to large vocabularies on LM1B. On the image dataset CIFAR-10, our models approach the sample quality and exceed the log-likelihood of the continuous-space DDPM model.\n\ntitle: Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models\nabstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) are a class of generative models which have recently been shown to produce excellent samples. We show that with a few simple modifications, DDPMs can also achieve competitive log-likelihoods while maintaining high sample quality. Additionally, we find that learning variances of the reverse diffusion process allows sampling with an order of magnitude fewer forward passes with a negligible difference in sample quality, which is important for the practical deployment of these models. We additionally use precision and recall to compare how well DDPMs and GANs cover the target distribution. Finally, we show that the sample quality and likelihood of these models scale smoothly with model capacity and training compute, making them easily scalable.

While sharp convergence guarantees have been established for the DDPM, the iteration complexity is, in general, proportional to the ambient data dimension, resulting in overly conservative theory that fails to explain its practical efficiency. This has motivated the recent work Li and Yan (2024a) to investigate how the DDPM can achieve sampling speed-ups through automatic exploitation of intrinsic low dimensionality of data. We strengthen this line of work by demonstrating, in some sense, optimal adaptivity to unknown low dimensionality. For a broad class of data distributions with intrinsic dimension $k$, we prove that the iteration complexity of the DDPM scales nearly linearly with $k$, which is optimal when using KL divergence to measure distributional discrepancy. Notably, our work is closely aligned with the independent concurrent work Potaptchik et al.

Despite their ubiquity it is hard to find an introduction to DDPMs which is simple, comprehensive, clean and clear. The compact explanations necessary in research papers are not able to elucidate all of the different design steps taken to formulate the DDPM and the rationale of the steps that are presented is often omitted to save space. Moreover, the expositions are typically presented from the variational lower bound perspective which is unnecessary and arguably harmful as it obfuscates why the method is working and suggests generalisations that do not perform well in practice. On the other hand, perspectives that take the continuous time-limit are beautiful and general, but they have a high barrier-to-entry as they require background knowledge of stochastic differential equations and probability flow. In this note, we distill down the formulation of the DDPM into six simple steps each of which comes with a clear rationale. We assume that the reader is familiar with fundamental topics in machine learning including basic probabilistic modelling, Gaussian distributions, maximum likelihood estimation, and deep learning.\n\ntitle: Adapting to Unknown Low-Dimensional Structures in Score-Based Diffusion   Models\nabstract: This paper investigates score-based diffusion models when the underlying target distribution is concentrated on or near low-dimensional manifolds within the higher-dimensional space in which they formally reside, a common characteristic of natural image distributions. Despite previous efforts to understand the data generation process of diffusion models, existing theoretical support remains highly suboptimal in the presence of low-dimensional structure, which we strengthen in this paper. For the popular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), we find that the dependency of the error incurred within each denoising step on the ambient dimension $d$ is in general unavoidable. We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner.\n\ntitle: Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces\nabstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) (Ho et al. 2020) have shown impressive results on image and waveform generation in continuous state spaces. Here, we introduce Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), diffusion-like generative models for discrete data that generalize the multinomial diffusion model of Hoogeboom et al. 2021, by going beyond corruption processes with uniform transition probabilities. This includes corruption with transition matrices that mimic Gaussian kernels in continuous space, matrices based on nearest neighbors in embedding space, and matrices that introduce absorbing states. The third allows us to draw a connection between diffusion models and autoregressive and mask-based generative models. We show that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision that leads to improved results in image and text domains. We also introduce a new loss function that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy loss. For text, this model class achieves strong results on character-level text generation while scaling to large vocabularies on LM1B. On the image dataset CIFAR-10, our models approach the sample quality and exceed the log-likelihood of the continuous-space DDPM model.\n\ntitle: Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models\nabstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) are a class of generative models which have recently been shown to produce excellent samples. We show that with a few simple modifications, DDPMs can also achieve competitive log-likelihoods while maintaining high sample quality. Additionally, we find that learning variances of the reverse diffusion process allows sampling with an order of magnitude fewer forward passes with a negligible difference in sample quality, which is important for the practical deployment of these models. We additionally use precision and recall to compare how well DDPMs and GANs cover the target distribution.

        "Problem Statement": "Fixed momentum weights in denoising fail to adapt to local manifold geometry, potentially causing instability in high-curvature regions or inefficiency in flat regions.",
        "Motivation": "Automatically adjusting momentum based on directional consistency can optimize both stability and efficiency by respecting local geometric properties during generation.",
        "Proposed Method": "Implement adaptive momentum by: 1) Tracking cosine similarity between consecutive denoising directions 2) Scaling momentum weight proportionally to this similarity 3) Using the adapted momentum to blend current and previous directions.",
        "Experiment": "1. Modify NoiseScheduler to compute directional similarities\n2. Implement momentum adaptation rule (e.g., momentum = similarity)\n3. Compare with fixed-momentum and baseline approaches\n4. Visualize momentum adaptation patterns\n5. Correlate automatic adjustments with local curvature estimates",

        "lit_review_results": "title: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are optimally adaptive to   unknown low dimensionality\nabstract: The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has emerged as a mainstream generative model in generative AI. While sharp convergence guarantees have been established for the DDPM, the iteration complexity is, in general, proportional to the ambient data dimension, resulting in overly conservative theory that fails to explain its practical efficiency. This has motivated the recent work Li and Yan (2024a) to investigate how the DDPM can achieve sampling speed-ups through automatic exploitation of intrinsic low dimensionality of data. We strengthen this line of work by demonstrating, in some sense, optimal adaptivity to unknown low dimensionality. For a broad class of data distributions with intrinsic dimension $k$, we prove that the iteration complexity of the DDPM scales nearly linearly with $k$, which is optimal when using KL divergence to measure distributional discrepancy. Notably, our work is closely aligned with the independent concurrent work Potaptchik et al. (2024) -- posted two weeks prior to ours -- in establishing nearly linear-$k$ convergence guarantees for the DDPM.\n\ntitle: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models in Six Simple Steps\nabstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) are a very popular class of deep generative model that have been successfully applied to a diverse range of problems including image and video generation, protein and material synthesis, weather forecasting, and neural surrogates of partial differential equations. Despite their ubiquity it is hard to find an introduction to DDPMs which is simple, comprehensive, clean and clear. The compact explanations necessary in research papers are not able to elucidate all of the different design steps taken to formulate the DDPM and the rationale of the steps that are presented is often omitted to save space. Moreover, the expositions are typically presented from the variational lower bound perspective which is unnecessary and arguably harmful as it obfuscates why the method is working and suggests generalisations that do not perform well in practice. On the other hand, perspectives that take the continuous time-limit are beautiful and general, but they have a high barrier-to-entry as they require background knowledge of stochastic differential equations and probability flow. In this note, we distill down the formulation of the DDPM into six simple steps each of which comes with a clear rationale. We assume that the reader is familiar with fundamental topics in machine learning including basic probabilistic modelling, Gaussian distributions, maximum likelihood estimation, and deep learning.\n\ntitle: Adapting to Unknown Low-Dimensional Structures in Score-Based Diffusion   Models\nabstract: This paper investigates score-based diffusion models when the underlying target distribution is concentrated on or near low-dimensional manifolds within the higher-dimensional space in which they formally reside, a common characteristic of natural image distributions. Despite previous efforts to understand the data generation process of diffusion models, existing theoretical support remains highly suboptimal in the presence of low-dimensional structure, which we strengthen in this paper. For the popular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), we find that the dependency of the error incurred within each denoising step on the ambient dimension $d$ is in general unavoidable. We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner.\n\ntitle: Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces\nabstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) (Ho et al. 2020) have shown impressive results on image and waveform generation in continuous state spaces. Here, we introduce Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), diffusion-like generative models for discrete data that generalize the multinomial diffusion model of Hoogeboom et al. 2021, by going beyond corruption processes with uniform transition probabilities. This includes corruption with transition matrices that mimic Gaussian kernels in continuous space, matrices based on nearest neighbors in embedding space, and matrices that introduce absorbing states. The third allows us to draw a connection between diffusion models and autoregressive and mask-based generative models. We show that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision that leads to improved results in image and text domains. We also introduce a new loss function that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy loss. For text, this model class achieves strong results on character-level text generation while scaling to large vocabularies on LM1B. On the image dataset CIFAR-10, our models approach the sample quality and exceed the log-likelihood of the continuous-space DDPM model.\n\ntitle: Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models\nabstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) are a class of generative models which have recently been shown to produce excellent samples. We show that with a few simple modifications, DDPMs can also achieve competitive log-likelihoods while maintaining high sample quality. Additionally, we find that learning variances of the reverse diffusion process allows sampling with an order of magnitude fewer forward passes with a negligible difference in sample quality, which is important for the practical deployment of these models. We additionally use precision and recall to compare how well DDPMs and GANs cover the target distribution. Finally, we show that the sample quality and likelihood of these models scale smoothly with model capacity and training compute, making them easily scalable.
