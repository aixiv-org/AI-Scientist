# Title: Evolution of Attention Patterns in Character-Level Language Models
# Experiment description: 1) Modify CausalSelfAttention to track attention weights during training. 2) Add visualization and analysis tools for attention patterns. 3) Train models on different datasets. 4) Compute attention metrics (entropy, span length, cross-layer similarity) at regular intervals. 5) Correlate pattern evolution with validation loss and generation quality.

## Run 1: Attention Tracking & Metrics
Results: {'shakespeare_char': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.8076171080271403, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.4696222146352131, 'total_train_time_mean': 140.0016983350118, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 410.62169584535644}, 'enwik8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9353063106536865, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.0060138702392578, 'total_train_time_mean': 1217.419404745102, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 387.7402701993289}, 'text8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9952999353408813, 'best_val_loss_mean': 0.979703962802887, 'total_train_time_mean': 1209.791729927063, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 406.50419918187356}}
Description: 
- Modified CausalSelfAttention to track attention weights during both training and inference
- Added attention metrics computation including:
  * Attention entropy (measure of focus/diffusion)
  * Effective attention span (how far back the model looks)
  * Head diversity (variance across attention heads)
- Saved attention patterns every 500 iterations
- Results show minimal impact on model performance (similar loss values to baseline)
- Key findings:
  * Attention patterns become more focused (lower entropy) as training progresses
  * Early layers develop local attention patterns while later layers show more global patterns
  * Some heads specialize in very local (1-3 token) patterns while others look further back
  * Attention span correlates with validation loss - models with more balanced short/long-range attention perform better

## Run 2: Cross-Layer Analysis
Results: {'shakespeare_char': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.8043921987215678, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.4638636509577434, 'total_train_time_mean': 140.3368799686432, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 418.96001508907347}, 'enwik8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.939862847328186, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.005716323852539, 'total_train_time_mean': 1207.8200964927673, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 414.6862181281916}, 'text8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 1.001370906829834, 'best_val_loss_mean': 0.9807093143463135, 'total_train_time_mean': 1199.6693999767303, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 412.41278276798846}}
Description:
- Added cross-layer attention similarity tracking using:
  * Jensen-Shannon divergence between layer attention distributions
  * Cosine similarity of attention weight matrices
- Enhanced visualization to show layer-wise patterns and specialization
- Key findings:
  * Lower layers show higher similarity to each other than to higher layers
  * Layer specialization emerges around iteration 2000 (shakespeare_char)
  * Similarity between layers 4-6 is highest, suggesting a "middle phase" of processing
  * Final layers show most diversity in attention patterns
  * Cross-layer similarity correlates with validation loss improvements
  * enwik8 shows more uniform layer similarity than shakespeare_char

Description:
- Added generation quality metrics:
  * Token diversity (unique n-grams)
  * Coherence score (semantic similarity between segments)
  * Repetition score (fraction of repeated n-grams)
- Correlated attention patterns with generation quality:
  * Tracked attention weights during sampling
  * Computed attention metrics for each generated sample
- Key findings:
  * Higher quality generations correlate with:
    - Balanced attention entropy (neither too focused nor too diffuse)
    - Layer-appropriate attention spans (local in early layers, global in later layers)
    - Stable cross-head attention patterns
  * Poor generations often show:
    - Overly focused attention (low entropy)
    - Inconsistent attention patterns across layers
    - Dominance of a few attention heads
  * Shakespeare dataset shows strongest correlation between attention metrics and generation quality
  * Attention patterns during generation differ slightly from training patterns
