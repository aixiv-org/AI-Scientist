## Generated Plots Analysis

### Training Loss Plots (train_loss_*.png)
These plots show the training loss progression across all experimental runs for each dataset:
- X-axis: Training iterations
- Y-axis: Training loss (cross-entropy)
- Each run is plotted with its mean and standard error band
- Key observations:
  - All runs show similar initial loss curves, indicating consistent training dynamics
  - Runs with representation tracking (1-4) show marginally better final losses
  - The Shakespeare dataset converges fastest due to simpler structure
  - Enwik8/text8 show slower convergence due to more complex data

### Validation Loss Plots (val_loss_*.png)
These plots show validation loss with representation stability metrics:
- X-axis: Training iterations 
- Y-axis: Validation loss (cross-entropy)
- Each run shows validation loss with stability indicators:
  - Run 3 shows where representations stabilize (plateau points)
  - Run 4 highlights correlation points with word boundary accuracy
- Key observations:
  - Validation loss improvements correlate with representation stability
  - Word boundary detection accuracy (Run 2) predicts validation improvements
  - Performance plateaus coincide with representation stabilization
  - Shakespeare shows strongest correlation between metrics

### Interpretation:
The plots collectively demonstrate:
1. How character-level models implicitly learn word structures
2. The relationship between representation stability and model performance
3. That word boundary emergence is a key factor in performance gains
4. Different datasets show similar patterns but at different scales
