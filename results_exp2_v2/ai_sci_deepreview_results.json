They considered four tasks and five initialization methods. Experiments show that the initialization methods significantly affect the grokking behavior.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n1\n\n### Contribution\n\n1\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe experiments are well-designed and show that weight initialization methods affect grokking.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\nThe main weakness of this paper is that the contribution and the novelty are unclear. The paper does experiments about the effect of weight initialization on grokking without any new insights. The paper is also not well-written and has many typos, which makes it hard to read. I suggest the authors improve the presentation of the paper and emphasize the contribution.\n\nSpecific weaknesses:\n- many typos, e.g. line 47, the citation should be (Vaswani et al., 2017); line 52, the citation should be (Power et al., 2022). There are also other typos in line 137-138.\n- line 42, it should be “the” Transformer models.\n- line 54, there is a redundant space.\n- line 57, “less intricate” should be “less complex”.\n- line 169, it should be “the” problem setting.\n- line 171-173, the notations are not clearly defined.\n- line 174, “are defined as” should be “is defined as”.\n- line 192, “where S99 is the number of steps to reach 99% accuracy” should be “where S99 is the number of steps to reach 99% validation accuracy”. Also, “accuracy” should not be defined as a metric.\n- line 209, “is a small Transformer” should be “is a small transformers”.\n- line 229, there should not be a blank unsed line before a reference.\n- line 239-243, the paper is not well-written here.\n- line 245-247, the sentence is unfinished.\n- line 260, “all possible input pairs” is not clearly defined.\n- line 265, “The model is trained” should be “The models are trained”.\n- line 267, there should not be a blank line before “By comparing”.\n- line 269-285, the paper is not well-written here.\n- line 288, “influenece” should be “influence”.\n- line 304, “Figure ?? provides” should be “Figure 1 provides”.\n- line 307, “Section 5.5” should be “Section 5.4”.\n- line 317, “Figure ??” should be “Figure 2”.\n- line 323, “Figure ??” should be “Figure 3”.\n- line 329, “Figure ??” should be “Figure 4”.\n- line 334, the confidence interval should be in the main text.\n- line 428, it should be “this” connection.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper's primary weakness lies in its lack of clear contribution and novelty. While the experiments are well-designed and demonstrate that weight initialization affects grokking, the paper fails to provide any new insights or deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The study essentially shows that different initializations lead to different grokking behaviors, which is not surprising given the existing literature on the sensitivity of neural network training to initialization. To improve the paper, the authors should focus on analyzing *why* different initializations lead to different grokking behaviors. For example, they could investigate the landscape of the loss function around the initial weights for each initialization method. This could involve analyzing the Hessian of the loss function or the curvature around the initial points. Such analysis could reveal whether certain initializations lead to a smoother loss landscape or a landscape that is more conducive to generalization. Furthermore, the authors could explore the relationship between the initial weight distribution and the learned representations. This could involve visualizing the learned embeddings or analyzing the activation patterns of the network. Such analysis could provide insights into how different initializations affect the learning process and the emergence of grokking.\n\nTo enhance the paper's contribution, the authors should also consider exploring the connection between their findings and existing theories of grokking. For instance, they could investigate whether certain initialization methods lead to a faster convergence of the network to a solution that generalizes well. This could involve analyzing the trajectory of the network's weights during training and comparing the paths taken by different initializations. Furthermore, the authors could explore the role of regularization in the grokking phenomenon. It is possible that certain initializations act as implicit regularizers, leading to better generalization performance. The authors could investigate this by analyzing the effective regularization induced by different initializations. This could involve techniques such as spectral analysis of the weight matrices or analysis of the network's sensitivity to input perturbations. By connecting their findings to existing theories and exploring the underlying mechanisms, the authors can significantly enhance the paper's contribution and novelty.\n\nFinally, the paper needs significant improvement in its presentation. The writing is often unclear and difficult to follow, and there are numerous typos and grammatical errors. The authors should carefully proofread the paper and ensure that the writing is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. The figures should also be improved to make them more informative and easier to understand. For example, the figures could include error bars to show the variability of the results. The authors should also ensure that the figures are properly referenced in the text and that the captions are clear and informative. The paper should also be structured in a more logical and coherent manner, with clear transitions between different sections. By addressing these issues, the authors can significantly improve the readability and impact of their paper.\n\n### Questions\n\n- What is the connection of this work to existing theories of grokking?\n\n### Rating\n\n1\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper investigates the impact of weight initialization strategies on grokking in Transformer models. Grokking refers to the sudden generalization after prolonged training. The authors systematically compare five initialization methods across four arithmetic tasks in finite fields using a small Transformer architecture. The results reveal significant differences in convergence speed and generalization capabilities across initialization strategies, with Xavier initialization consistently outperforming others.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n1\n\n### Contribution\n\n1\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper provides a comprehensive study of the effects of weight initialization strategies on grokking in Transformer models, demonstrating that different initialization methods can significantly influence grokking behavior.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper is not well-written, with many grammatical errors and unclear sentences. For example, in Section 3.1, the sentence \"Each task Ti is defined as an operation over a finite field Fp, where p = 97 (a prime number). The model receives input sequences to predict the result of the arithmetic operation x y = (a, b), where each xj ∈ Fp, and is trained\" is difficult to understand. The description of the input sequence and the variables 'a' and 'b' is particularly vague. It is unclear how the input sequence is structured and how it relates to the arithmetic operation. The variable 'xj' is defined as an element of Fp, but its relation to the input sequence is not clear. The training process is only mentioned briefly without any details on the training objective or the data used.\n\n2. The paper lacks a clear explanation of the connection between weight initialization and grokking. While it presents empirical results showing that different initialization methods affect grokking, it does not provide a theoretical analysis or insights into why this is the case. The paper only describes the observed effects without delving into the underlying mechanisms. For instance, it does not explore how different initializations affect the optimization landscape or the learning dynamics of the model. The lack of theoretical grounding makes it difficult to understand the significance of the results.\n\n3. The paper does not adequately address the limitations of the study. For example, the experiments are conducted on a small Transformer architecture and arithmetic tasks in finite fields, which may not fully represent the complexity of real-world problems. The paper does not discuss how the findings might generalize to larger models or different tasks. The choice of arithmetic tasks in finite fields is also not well-justified, and it is unclear whether the observed phenomena are specific to this setting or more general.\n\n4. The paper does not provide a clear definition of grokking. While it refers to previous work, it does not explicitly define what constitutes grokking in the context of this study. The lack of a clear definition makes it difficult to interpret the results and compare them with other studies. The paper should provide a precise definition of grokking, including the specific metrics used to measure generalization and the criteria for identifying the onset of grokking.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper needs significant improvements in clarity and technical depth. First, the authors should provide a more detailed and precise description of the experimental setup. This includes a clear explanation of how the input sequences are generated, how they relate to the arithmetic operations, and how the model is trained. The variables used in the description should be clearly defined, and the training process should be explained in detail, including the loss function, the optimization algorithm, and the data used for training and validation. For example, the authors could provide a concrete example of an input sequence and its corresponding target output for each arithmetic task. This would greatly enhance the readability and reproducibility of the study. Furthermore, the authors should justify their choice of arithmetic tasks in finite fields and discuss the limitations of this setting.\n\nSecond, the paper needs a more in-depth analysis of the connection between weight initialization and grokking. The authors should explore how different initialization methods affect the optimization landscape and the learning dynamics of the model. This could involve analyzing the gradient flow, the spectral properties of the weight matrices, or the evolution of the model's representations during training. The authors should also discuss the theoretical implications of their findings and relate them to existing theories of generalization and optimization. For example, they could investigate whether certain initializations lead to a smoother loss landscape or a more favorable alignment of gradients. This would provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying grokking and the role of weight initialization.\n\nFinally, the paper should provide a clear and precise definition of grokking, including the specific metrics used to measure generalization and the criteria for identifying the onset of grokking. The authors should also discuss the limitations of their study and the potential for future research. This includes addressing the generalizability of their findings to larger models and different tasks, as well as exploring the role of other factors that might influence grokking, such as the learning rate or the batch size. The authors should also consider comparing their results with other studies on grokking and discuss the similarities and differences. This would help to place their work in a broader context and highlight its contributions to the field.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. What is the exact connection between weight initialization and grokking? The paper shows that different initialization methods affect grokking but does not explain why this is the case. A deeper analysis of the underlying mechanisms would be valuable.\n\n2. How do the findings of this study relate to existing theories of grokking? The paper does not adequately connect its results to the broader theoretical understanding of this phenomenon.\n\n3. Can the results be generalized to larger models or different tasks? The experiments are conducted on a small Transformer architecture and arithmetic tasks in finite fields, which may not fully represent the complexity of real-world problems.\n\n4. What are the limitations of this study, and how could they be addressed in future work? The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of its experimental setup and the scope of its conclusions.\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n2\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 3\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper investigates the impact of different weight initialization strategies on grokking in Transformer models.

The experimental setup is well-controlled, using a small Transformer architecture and four arithmetic tasks in finite fields to ensure reproducibility and facilitate a focused analysis of grokking.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms that explain why certain initialization methods perform better than others in the context of grokking. Specifically, the paper does not delve into how different initializations affect the optimization landscape, such as the distribution of gradients or the presence of saddle points, which could explain the observed differences in convergence speed and generalization. Furthermore, the paper does not explore the impact of initialization on the feature representations learned by the model, which could provide insights into why some initializations lead to better generalization.\n2. The study is limited to a small Transformer architecture and four arithmetic tasks in finite fields, which may not fully represent the complexity of real-world problems. The chosen tasks, while useful for controlled experiments, may not capture the nuances of more complex tasks with hierarchical structures or those involving natural language. The paper does not provide any evidence that the observed effects of initialization on grokking would generalize to larger models or more diverse tasks, which limits the practical applicability of the findings.\n3. The paper does not explore the interaction between initialization strategies and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules or model architectures. The choice of learning rate and its schedule can significantly impact the training dynamics, and it is possible that the optimal initialization method is dependent on these choices. Similarly, the paper does not investigate how the observed effects of initialization on grokking might change with different model architectures, such as varying the number of layers or attention heads.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo strengthen the paper, the authors should conduct a more in-depth analysis of the optimization dynamics under different initialization schemes. This could involve visualizing the loss landscape and gradient norms during training to understand how different initializations affect the optimization trajectory. Specifically, the authors could investigate whether certain initializations lead to smoother loss landscapes or more stable gradient flows, which could explain their superior performance in grokking. Furthermore, analyzing the feature representations learned by the model under different initializations could provide insights into why some initializations lead to better generalization. For example, the authors could examine the similarity of feature representations across different tasks or the alignment of features with the target function. This analysis should go beyond simply observing the final performance and delve into the underlying mechanisms that drive the observed differences.\n\nTo address the limitations of the current experimental setup, the authors should extend their study to more complex tasks and larger models. This could involve using benchmark datasets from natural language processing or computer vision, which would provide a more realistic assessment of the practical applicability of their findings. The authors should also investigate how the observed effects of initialization on grokking change with different model architectures, such as varying the number of layers or attention heads. This would help to determine whether the findings are specific to the chosen architecture or generalize to other model configurations. Additionally, the authors should explore the impact of different data distributions on the observed effects of initialization, as the current study is limited to arithmetic tasks in finite fields.\n\nFinally, the authors should investigate the interaction between initialization strategies and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules and optimizers. This could involve conducting a systematic hyperparameter search to identify the optimal combination of initialization method, learning rate, and optimizer for each task. The authors should also explore whether the optimal initialization method is dependent on the choice of learning rate schedule or optimizer. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence grokking and would help to develop more robust and reliable training strategies. Furthermore, the authors should consider exploring adaptive initialization methods that evolve during training, as these methods could potentially lead to more robust and efficient learning algorithms.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

The authors focus on four arithmetic tasks within finite fields, using a small Transformer architecture to ensure controlled experiments. They systematically compare five initialization methods: PyTorch default, Xavier (Glorot), He, Orthogonal, and Kaiming Normal. The core methodology involves training the Transformer models on these tasks using different initialization schemes and monitoring training and validation performance, with a particular emphasis on the time it takes to reach 99% validation accuracy (S99), which serves as a measure of grokking speed. The empirical results reveal significant differences in convergence speed and generalization capabilities across the initialization strategies. Notably, the Xavier initialization consistently outperforms the others, leading to faster convergence and higher validation accuracy across most tasks. The study also observes that Orthogonal initialization performs well in some tasks, particularly permutation composition, while the PyTorch default initialization tends to converge slower. The paper's primary contribution lies in demonstrating the significant influence of weight initialization on the grokking phenomenon, highlighting that different initializations can lead to markedly different learning trajectories and generalization outcomes. While the paper provides a comprehensive empirical analysis, it lacks a deep theoretical exploration of the underlying mechanisms that explain these observed differences. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their study, particularly the use of a small Transformer architecture and arithmetic tasks in finite fields, which may not fully represent the complexity of real-world problems. Despite these limitations, the paper provides valuable insights into the role of initialization in grokking and suggests potential avenues for further research in this area. The findings suggest that careful selection of initialization methods can be a crucial factor in achieving efficient training and better generalization, especially in scenarios where grokking is observed. The paper's focus on a controlled experimental setting allows for a clear observation of the impact of initialization, although further research is needed to understand how these findings generalize to more complex models and tasks.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThis paper presents a well-structured empirical investigation into the impact of weight initialization on the grokking phenomenon in Transformer models. The authors have clearly defined their research question and have employed a systematic approach to address it. The use of a small Transformer architecture and arithmetic tasks in finite fields, while limiting in some respects, allows for a controlled and reproducible experimental setup. This choice facilitates a focused analysis of grokking behavior, minimizing the influence of confounding factors. The selection of five different initialization methods, including PyTorch default, Xavier, He, Orthogonal, and Kaiming Normal, provides a comprehensive comparison of commonly used strategies. The experimental design is rigorous, with multiple runs for each combination of task and initialization method, ensuring the statistical validity of the results. The authors have also clearly defined their evaluation metrics, particularly the S99 metric, which measures the number of steps to reach 99% validation accuracy, providing a clear and quantifiable measure of grokking speed. The results are presented clearly, with figures and tables that effectively summarize the key findings. The observation that Xavier initialization consistently leads to faster convergence and higher validation accuracy is a significant empirical contribution. The paper also provides practical guidelines for initialization in similar learning scenarios, suggesting that careful selection of initialization methods can be a crucial factor in achieving efficient training and better generalization. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their study, which demonstrates a strong awareness of the scope and applicability of their findings. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its clear methodology, well-controlled experiments, and the identification of significant empirical differences in grokking behavior across different initialization strategies. The paper's focus on a controlled experimental setting allows for a clear observation of the impact of initialization, although further research is needed to understand how these findings generalize to more complex models and tasks.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile this paper presents a valuable empirical investigation, several weaknesses limit the scope and impact of its findings. A primary concern is the lack of a detailed theoretical analysis explaining *why* certain initialization methods perform better than others in the context of grokking. The paper demonstrates that different initializations lead to different grokking behaviors, but it does not delve into the underlying mechanisms. For instance, the paper does not explore how different initializations affect the optimization landscape, such as the distribution of gradients or the presence of saddle points, which could explain the observed differences in convergence speed and generalization capabilities. This lack of theoretical grounding makes it difficult to understand the significance of the results beyond the specific experimental setup. The paper also suffers from a limited experimental scope. The study is conducted using a small Transformer architecture with only two layers, 128 model dimensions, and four attention heads. This architecture may not fully capture the complexities of larger, more realistic Transformer models. Furthermore, the experiments are limited to four arithmetic tasks in finite fields. While these tasks provide a controlled environment, they may not fully represent the complexity of real-world problems, particularly those involving hierarchical structures or natural language. It is unclear whether the observed effects of initialization on grokking would generalize to larger models or more diverse tasks. The paper also does not explore the interaction between initialization strategies and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules or model architectures. The choice of learning rate and its schedule can significantly impact the training dynamics, and it is possible that the optimal initialization method is dependent on these choices. Similarly, the paper does not investigate how the observed effects of initialization on grokking might change with different model architectures, such as varying the number of layers or attention heads. This lack of exploration limits the understanding of the robustness of the findings. The paper also suffers from some writing and presentation issues. The description of the input sequence and the variables 'a' and 'b' in Section 3.1 is vague and difficult to understand. The sentence, \"Each task Ti is defined as an operation over a finite field Fp, where p = 97 (a prime number). The model receives input sequences to predict the result of the arithmetic operation x y = (a, b), where each xj ∈ Fp, and is trained,\" is unclear about how the input sequence is structured and how it relates to the arithmetic operation. The variable 'xj' is defined as an element of Fp, but its relation to the input sequence is not clear. The training process is only mentioned briefly without any details on the training objective or the data used. Additionally, the paper lacks a clear definition of grokking. While it refers to previous work, it does not explicitly define what constitutes grokking in the context of this study. The lack of a clear definition makes it difficult to interpret the results and compare them with other studies. The paper should provide a precise definition of grokking, including the specific metrics used to measure generalization and the criteria for identifying the onset of grokking. Finally, the paper does not adequately connect its findings to existing theories of grokking. While it mentions previous work, it does not delve into how the current findings align with or challenge existing theoretical frameworks explaining grokking. This lack of connection limits the broader impact and understanding of the findings. These weaknesses, taken together, limit the generalizability and theoretical significance of the paper's results. The lack of mechanistic explanations, the limited experimental scope, and the absence of connections to existing theories hinder the paper's ability to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between weight initialization and grokking.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo strengthen this paper, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should conduct a more in-depth analysis of the optimization dynamics under different initialization schemes. This could involve visualizing the loss landscape and gradient norms during training to understand how different initializations affect the optimization trajectory. Specifically, the authors could investigate whether certain initializations lead to smoother loss landscapes or more stable gradient flows, which could explain their superior performance in grokking. Furthermore, analyzing the feature representations learned by the model under different initializations could provide insights into why some initializations lead to better generalization. For example, the authors could examine the similarity of feature representations across different tasks or the alignment of features with the target function. This analysis should go beyond simply observing the final performance and delve into the underlying mechanisms that drive the observed differences. Second, the authors should extend their study to more complex tasks and larger models. This could involve using benchmark datasets from natural language processing or computer vision, which would provide a more realistic assessment of the practical applicability of their findings. The authors should also investigate how the observed effects of initialization on grokking change with different model architectures, such as varying the number of layers or attention heads. This would help to determine whether the findings are specific to the chosen architecture or generalize to other model configurations. Additionally, the authors should explore the impact of different data distributions on the observed effects of initialization, as the current study is limited to arithmetic tasks in finite fields. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence grokking and would help to develop more robust and reliable training strategies. Third, the authors should investigate the interaction between initialization strategies and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules and optimizers. This could involve conducting a systematic hyperparameter search to identify the optimal combination of initialization method, learning rate, and optimizer for each task. The authors should also explore whether the optimal initialization method is dependent on the choice of learning rate schedule or optimizer. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence grokking and would help to develop more robust and reliable training strategies. Furthermore, the authors should consider exploring adaptive initialization methods that evolve during training, as these methods could potentially lead to more robust and efficient learning algorithms. Fourth, the authors should significantly improve the clarity of their writing, particularly in the description of the experimental setup. They should provide a more detailed and precise explanation of how the input sequences are generated, how they relate to the arithmetic operations, and how the model is trained. The variables used in the description should be clearly defined, and the training process should be explained in detail, including the loss function, the optimization algorithm, and the data used for training and validation. For example, the authors could provide a concrete example of an input sequence and its corresponding target output for each arithmetic task. This would greatly enhance the readability and reproducibility of the study. Fifth, the authors should provide a clear and precise definition of grokking, including the specific metrics used to measure generalization and the criteria for identifying the onset of grokking. This definition should be consistent throughout the paper. Finally, the authors should explicitly connect their findings to existing theories of grokking. They should discuss how their results align with or challenge existing theoretical frameworks and explore the implications of their findings for the broader understanding of deep learning optimization and generalization. By addressing these points, the authors can significantly enhance the paper's contribution and impact.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nSeveral key questions arise from this study that warrant further investigation. First, what are the specific mechanisms by which different weight initialization methods influence the grokking phenomenon? While the paper demonstrates that different initializations lead to different grokking behaviors, it does not explain *why* this occurs. A deeper analysis of the optimization landscape and the learning dynamics under different initializations is needed. For example, how do different initializations affect the distribution of gradients, the presence of saddle points, or the alignment of gradients during training? Second, how do the findings of this study relate to existing theories of grokking? The paper mentions previous work but does not explicitly connect its results to broader theoretical frameworks. It would be valuable to explore how the observed effects of initialization align with or challenge existing theories of generalization and optimization. Third, can the results of this study be generalized to larger models and more complex tasks? The experiments are conducted on a small Transformer architecture and arithmetic tasks in finite fields. It is unclear whether the observed effects of initialization on grokking would generalize to larger models or more diverse tasks, such as those involving natural language or computer vision. Fourth, what is the role of other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules and optimizers, in the observed effects of initialization on grokking? The paper uses a fixed learning rate schedule and optimizer. It would be valuable to explore how the interaction between initialization and these hyperparameters affects the grokking phenomenon. Fifth, are there any adaptive initialization methods that could potentially lead to more robust and efficient learning algorithms? The paper focuses on static initialization methods. It would be interesting to explore whether adaptive initialization methods that evolve during training could further improve the grokking behavior of Transformer models. Finally, what are the practical implications of these findings for developing more efficient training strategies in complex learning tasks? The paper provides some practical guidelines, but it would be valuable to explore how these findings can be applied in real-world scenarios beyond the controlled experimental setup. Addressing these questions would significantly enhance our understanding of the grokking phenomenon and its relationship to weight initialization.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

The paper does experiments about the effect of weight initialization on grokking without any new insights. The paper is also not well-written and has many typos, which makes it hard to read. I suggest the authors improve the presentation of the paper and emphasize the contribution.\n\nSpecific weaknesses:\n- many typos, e.g. line 47, the citation should be (Vaswani et al., 2017); line 52, the citation should be (Power et al., 2022).

While the experiments are well-designed and demonstrate that weight initialization affects grokking, the paper fails to provide any new insights or deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The study essentially shows that different initializations lead to different grokking behaviors, which is not surprising given the existing literature on the sensitivity of neural network training to initialization. To improve the paper, the authors should focus on analyzing *why* different initializations lead to different grokking behaviors. For example, they could investigate the landscape of the loss function around the initial weights for each initialization method. This could involve analyzing the Hessian of the loss function or the curvature around the initial points. Such analysis could reveal whether certain initializations lead to a smoother loss landscape or a landscape that is more conducive to generalization. Furthermore, the authors could explore the relationship between the initial weight distribution and the learned representations. This could involve visualizing the learned embeddings or analyzing the activation patterns of the network. Such analysis could provide insights into how different initializations affect the learning process and the emergence of grokking.\n\nTo enhance the paper's contribution, the authors should also consider exploring the connection between their findings and existing theories of grokking. For instance, they could investigate whether certain initialization methods lead to a faster convergence of the network to a solution that generalizes well. This could involve analyzing the trajectory of the network's weights during training and comparing the paths taken by different initializations. Furthermore, the authors could explore the role of regularization in the grokking phenomenon. It is possible that certain initializations act as implicit regularizers, leading to better generalization performance. The authors could investigate this by analyzing the effective regularization induced by different initializations. This could involve techniques such as spectral analysis of the weight matrices or analysis of the network's sensitivity to input perturbations. By connecting their findings to existing theories and exploring the underlying mechanisms, the authors can significantly enhance the paper's contribution and novelty.\n\nFinally, the paper needs significant improvement in its presentation. The writing is often unclear and difficult to follow, and there are numerous typos and grammatical errors. The authors should carefully proofread the paper and ensure that the writing is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. The figures should also be improved to make them more informative and easier to understand. For example, the figures could include error bars to show the variability of the results. The authors should also ensure that the figures are properly referenced in the text and that the captions are clear and informative. The paper should also be structured in a more logical and coherent manner, with clear transitions between different sections. By addressing these issues, the authors can significantly improve the readability and impact of their paper.\n\n### Questions\n\n- What is the connection of this work to existing theories of grokking?\n\n### Rating\n\n1\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********"

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper investigates the impact of different weight initialization strategies on the grokking phenomenon in Transformer models, a sudden improvement in generalization performance after prolonged training. The authors focus on four arithmetic tasks within finite fields, using a small Transformer architecture to ensure controlled experiments. They systematically compare five initialization methods: PyTorch default, Xavier (Glorot), He, Orthogonal, and Kaiming Normal. The core methodology involves training the Transformer models on these tasks using different initialization schemes and monitoring training and validation performance, with a particular emphasis on the time it takes to reach 99% validation accuracy (S99), which serves as a measure of grokking speed. The empirical results reveal significant differences in convergence speed and generalization capabilities across the initialization strategies. Notably, the Xavier initialization consistently outperforms the others, leading to faster convergence and higher validation accuracy across most tasks. The study also observes that Orthogonal initialization performs well in some tasks, particularly permutation composition, while the PyTorch default initialization tends to converge slower. The paper's primary contribution lies in demonstrating the significant influence of weight initialization on the grokking phenomenon, highlighting that different initializations can lead to markedly different learning trajectories and generalization outcomes. While the paper provides a comprehensive empirical analysis, it lacks a deep theoretical exploration of the underlying mechanisms that explain these observed differences. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their study, particularly the use of a small Transformer architecture and arithmetic tasks in finite fields, which may not fully represent the complexity of real-world problems. Despite these limitations, the paper provides valuable insights into the role of initialization in grokking and suggests potential avenues for further research in this area. The findings suggest that careful selection of initialization methods can be a crucial factor in achieving efficient training and better generalization, especially in scenarios where grokking is observed. The paper's focus on a controlled experimental setting allows for a clear observation of the impact of initialization, although further research is needed to understand how these findings generalize to more complex models and tasks.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThis paper presents a well-structured empirical investigation into the impact of weight initialization on the grokking phenomenon in Transformer models. The authors have clearly defined their research question and have employed a systematic approach to address it. The use of a small Transformer architecture and arithmetic tasks in finite fields, while limiting in some respects, allows for a controlled and reproducible experimental setup. This choice facilitates a focused analysis of grokking behavior, minimizing the influence of confounding factors. The selection of five different initialization methods, including PyTorch default, Xavier, He, Orthogonal, and Kaiming Normal, provides a comprehensive comparison of commonly used strategies. The experimental design is rigorous, with multiple runs for each combination of task and initialization method, ensuring the statistical validity of the results. The authors have also clearly defined their evaluation metrics, particularly the S99 metric, which measures the number of steps to reach 99% validation accuracy, providing a clear and quantifiable measure of grokking speed. The results are presented clearly, with figures and tables that effectively summarize the key findings. The observation that Xavier initialization consistently leads to faster convergence and higher validation accuracy is a significant empirical contribution. The paper also provides practical guidelines for initialization in similar learning scenarios, suggesting that careful selection of initialization methods can be a crucial factor in achieving efficient training and better generalization. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their study, which demonstrates a strong awareness of the scope and applicability of their findings. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its clear methodology, well-controlled experiments, and the identification of significant empirical differences in grokking behavior across different initialization strategies. The paper's focus on a controlled experimental setting allows for a clear observation of the impact of initialization, although further research is needed to understand how these findings generalize to more complex models and tasks.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile this paper presents a valuable empirical investigation, several weaknesses limit the scope and impact of its findings. A primary concern is the lack of a detailed theoretical analysis explaining *why* certain initialization methods perform better than others in the context of grokking. The paper demonstrates that different initializations lead to different grokking behaviors, but it does not delve into the underlying mechanisms. For instance, the paper does not explore how different initializations affect the optimization landscape, such as the distribution of gradients or the presence of saddle points, which could explain the observed differences in convergence speed and generalization capabilities. This lack of theoretical grounding makes it difficult to understand the significance of the results beyond the specific experimental setup. The paper also suffers from a limited experimental scope. The study is conducted using a small Transformer architecture with only two layers, 128 model dimensions, and four attention heads. This architecture may not fully capture the complexities of larger, more realistic Transformer models. Furthermore, the experiments are limited to four arithmetic tasks in finite fields. While these tasks provide a controlled environment, they may not fully represent the complexity of real-world problems, particularly those involving hierarchical structures or natural language. It is unclear whether the observed effects of initialization on grokking would generalize to larger models or more diverse tasks. The paper also does not explore the interaction between initialization strategies and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules or model architectures. The choice of learning rate and its schedule can significantly impact the training dynamics, and it is possible that the optimal initialization method is dependent on these choices. Similarly, the paper does not investigate how the observed effects of initialization on grokking might change with different model architectures, such as varying the number of layers or attention heads. This lack of exploration limits the understanding of the robustness of the findings. The paper also suffers from some writing and presentation issues. The description of the input sequence and the variables 'a' and 'b' in Section 3.1 is vague and difficult to understand. The sentence, \"Each task Ti is defined as an operation over a finite field Fp, where p = 97 (a prime number). The model receives input sequences to predict the result of the arithmetic operation x y = (a, b), where each xj ∈ Fp, and is trained,\" is unclear about how the input sequence is structured and how it relates to the arithmetic operation. The variable 'xj' is defined as an element of Fp, but its relation to the input sequence is not clear. The training process is only mentioned briefly without any details on the training objective or the data used. Additionally, the paper lacks a clear definition of grokking. While it refers to previous work, it does not explicitly define what constitutes grokking in the context of this study. The lack of a clear definition makes it difficult to interpret the results and compare them with other studies. The paper should provide a precise definition of grokking, including the specific metrics used to measure generalization and the criteria for identifying the onset of grokking. Finally, the paper does not adequately connect its findings to existing theories of grokking. While it mentions previous work, it does not delve into how the current findings align with or challenge existing theoretical frameworks explaining grokking. This lack of connection limits the broader impact and understanding of the findings. These weaknesses, taken together, limit the generalizability and theoretical significance of the paper's results. The lack of mechanistic explanations, the limited experimental scope, and the absence of connections to existing theories hinder the paper's ability to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between weight initialization and grokking.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo strengthen this paper, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should conduct a more in-depth analysis of the optimization dynamics under different initialization schemes. This could involve visualizing the loss landscape and gradient norms during training to understand how different initializations affect the optimization trajectory. Specifically, the authors could investigate whether certain initializations lead to smoother loss landscapes or more stable gradient flows, which could explain their superior performance in grokking. Furthermore, analyzing the feature representations learned by the model under different initializations could provide insights into why some initializations lead to better generalization. For example, the authors could examine the similarity of feature representations across different tasks or the alignment of features with the target function. This analysis should go beyond simply observing the final performance and delve into the underlying mechanisms that drive the observed differences. Second, the authors should extend their study to more complex tasks and larger models. This could involve using benchmark datasets from natural language processing or computer vision, which would provide a more realistic assessment of the practical applicability of their findings. The authors should also investigate how the observed effects of initialization on grokking change with different model architectures, such as varying the number of layers or attention heads. This would help to determine whether the findings are specific to the chosen architecture or generalize to other model configurations. Additionally, the authors should explore the impact of different data distributions on the observed effects of initialization, as the current study is limited to arithmetic tasks in finite fields. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence grokking and would help to develop more robust and reliable training strategies. Third, the authors should investigate the interaction between initialization strategies and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules and optimizers. This could involve conducting a systematic hyperparameter search to identify the optimal combination of initialization method, learning rate, and optimizer for each task. The authors should also explore whether the optimal initialization method is dependent on the choice of learning rate schedule or optimizer. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence grokking and would help to develop more robust and reliable training strategies. Furthermore, the authors should consider exploring adaptive initialization methods that evolve during training, as these methods could potentially lead to more robust and efficient learning algorithms. Fourth, the authors should significantly improve the clarity of their writing, particularly in the description of the experimental setup. They should provide a more detailed and precise explanation of how the input sequences are generated, how they relate to the arithmetic operations, and how the model is trained. The variables used in the description should be clearly defined, and the training process should be explained in detail, including the loss function, the optimization algorithm, and the data used for training and validation. For example, the authors could provide a concrete example of an input sequence and its corresponding target output for each arithmetic task. This would greatly enhance the readability and reproducibility of the study. Fifth, the authors should provide a clear and precise definition of grokking, including the specific metrics used to measure generalization and the criteria for identifying the onset of grokking. This definition should be consistent throughout the paper. Finally, the authors should explicitly connect their findings to existing theories of grokking. They should discuss how their results align with or challenge existing theoretical frameworks and explore the implications of their findings for the broader understanding of deep learning optimization and generalization. By addressing these points, the authors can significantly enhance the paper's contribution and impact.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nSeveral key questions arise from this study that warrant further investigation. First, what are the specific mechanisms by which different weight initialization methods influence the grokking phenomenon? While the paper demonstrates that different initializations lead to different grokking behaviors, it does not explain *why* this occurs. A deeper analysis of the optimization landscape and the learning dynamics under different initializations is needed. For example, how do different initializations affect the distribution of gradients, the presence of saddle points, or the alignment of gradients during training? Second, how do the findings of this study relate to existing theories of grokking? The paper mentions previous work but does not explicitly connect its results to broader theoretical frameworks. It would be valuable to explore how the observed effects of initialization align with or challenge existing theories of generalization and optimization. Third, can the results of this study be generalized to larger models and more complex tasks? The experiments are conducted on a small Transformer architecture and arithmetic tasks in finite fields. It is unclear whether the observed effects of initialization on grokking would generalize to larger models or more diverse tasks, such as those involving natural language or computer vision. Fourth, what is the role of other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules and optimizers, in the observed effects of initialization on grokking? The paper uses a fixed learning rate schedule and optimizer. It would be valuable to explore how the interaction between initialization and these hyperparameters affects the grokking phenomenon. Fifth, are there any adaptive initialization methods that could potentially lead to more robust and efficient learning algorithms? The paper focuses on static initialization methods. It would be interesting to explore whether adaptive initialization methods that evolve during training could further improve the grokking behavior of Transformer models. Finally, what are the practical implications of these findings for developing more efficient training strategies in complex learning tasks? The paper provides some practical guidelines, but it would be valuable to explore how these findings can be applied in real-world scenarios beyond the controlled experimental setup. Addressing these questions would significantly enhance our understanding of the grokking phenomenon and its relationship to weight initialization.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",
                "summary": "This paper investigates the impact of different weight initialization strategies on the grokking phenomenon in Transformer models, a sudden improvement in generalization performance after prolonged training. The authors focus on four arithmetic tasks within finite fields, using a small Transformer architecture to ensure controlled experiments. They systematically compare five initialization methods: PyTorch default, Xavier (Glorot), He, Orthogonal, and Kaiming Normal. The core methodology involves training the Transformer models on these tasks using different initialization schemes and monitoring training and validation performance, with a particular emphasis on the time it takes to reach 99% validation accuracy (S99), which serves as a measure of grokking speed. The empirical results reveal significant differences in convergence speed and generalization capabilities across the initialization strategies. Notably, the Xavier initialization consistently outperforms the others, leading to faster convergence and higher validation accuracy across most tasks. The study also observes that Orthogonal initialization performs well in some tasks, particularly permutation composition, while the PyTorch default initialization tends to converge slower. The paper's primary contribution lies in demonstrating the significant influence of weight initialization on the grokking phenomenon, highlighting that different initializations can lead to markedly different learning trajectories and generalization outcomes. While the paper provides a comprehensive empirical analysis, it lacks a deep theoretical exploration of the underlying mechanisms that explain these observed differences. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their study, particularly the use of a small Transformer architecture and arithmetic tasks in finite fields, which may not fully represent the complexity of real-world problems. Despite these limitations, the paper provides valuable insights into the role of initialization in grokking and suggests potential avenues for further research in this area. The findings suggest that careful selection of initialization methods can be a crucial factor in achieving efficient training and better generalization, especially in scenarios where grokking is observed. The paper's focus on a controlled experimental setting allows for a clear observation of the impact of initialization, although further research is needed to understand how these findings generalize to more complex models and tasks.",

The authors propose a Q-learning based approach that uses the validation loss and current learning rate as the state, adjusting the learning rate to optimize the training process. The proposed method is evaluated on three datasets, showing comparable performance.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2 fair\n\n### Presentation\n\n1 poor\n\n### Contribution\n\n1 poor\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The proposed method is straightforward and easy to understand.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n[1] A practical guide to hyperparameter optimization in deep learning.\n\n#### comment\n\n - The experiments are very limited: the authors only compare the proposed method with the default configuration, without any other baselines or ablation studies. According to [1], the default configuration is not the optimal configuration for training transformers, and the optimal configuration could be different for different datasets. Therefore, it is unfair to compare other methods with the default configuration. Also, the authors should include other RL methods and learning rate schedulers as baselines.\n\n- The results are not very promising: the proposed method shows almost no improvement compared to the baseline configuration.\n\n- The presentation is poor: the paper is not well-written, and the figures and tables are not well-formatted. For example, the citation in line 53 is incorrect, and the tables are not properly aligned.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe experimental evaluation needs significant improvement to properly assess the proposed method's effectiveness. Comparing against only the default configuration is insufficient, as it is well-established that hyperparameter tuning can significantly impact performance, especially for transformer models. The authors should include a wider range of baselines, including other RL-based methods for learning rate adaptation, as well as established learning rate schedulers like cosine annealing with and without warmup. Furthermore, ablation studies are crucial to understand the impact of different components of the proposed Q-learning approach. For example, varying the state space, action space, and reward function could provide valuable insights into the method's sensitivity to these design choices. The experiments should also be conducted on a broader range of datasets to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method. Without these additional experiments, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the method's practical value.\n\nTo improve the presentation, the authors should focus on clarity and precision. The paper needs a thorough revision to improve the writing quality, ensuring that the ideas are conveyed clearly and concisely. The figures and tables should be formatted according to the conference guidelines, with proper alignment and spacing. Specifically, the citation in line 53 needs to be corrected, and the tables should be properly aligned with the surrounding text. The authors should also consider using more informative visualizations to illustrate the behavior of the proposed method. For example, plotting the learning rate trajectory over time for different methods could provide valuable insights into how the proposed method adapts the learning rate compared to baselines. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of the experimental setup, including the specific hyperparameters used for each method.\n\nFinally, the authors should consider exploring different reward functions for the Q-learning algorithm. The current reward function, based solely on validation loss, might not be optimal for encouraging exploration and long-term performance. For example, incorporating a reward based on the improvement in validation loss over time could encourage the agent to explore more aggressively. Additionally, the authors should consider using a more sophisticated RL algorithm, such as an actor-critic method, which might be better suited for this problem. The current Q-learning approach is relatively simple and might not be able to capture the complex dynamics of the learning rate adaptation process. Exploring these alternative approaches could lead to more significant improvements in performance.\n\n### Questions\n\n- What is the reward function for the Q-learning algorithm? According to Section 3.2, the reward is based on the improvement in validation performance, which means the agent will only decrease the learning rate, leading to very slow convergence. I think the authors meant that the reward is based on the improvement in validation loss.\n\n- In Section 6.1, the authors mention that \"The Q-learning based approach consistently outperforms the baseline in terms of validation loss and training efficiency.\" However, according to Table 1, the improvement is negligible.\n\n### Rating\n\n1: strong reject\n\n### Confidence\n\n4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes a Q-learning-based approach to dynamically adjust the learning rate during the training of transformer models. The approach uses the validation loss and current learning rate as the state, and the action is the adjustment to the learning rate. The reward signal is derived from the improvement in validation performance. The experiments on three datasets show that the proposed approach leads to faster convergence and better final performance compared to traditional methods.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2 fair\n\n### Presentation\n\n2 fair\n\n### Contribution\n\n2 fair\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. This paper proposes a novel Q-learning-based approach to dynamically adjust the learning rate during the training of transformer models. \n2. The proposed approach is evaluated on three datasets, showing faster convergence and better final performance compared to traditional methods.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper lacks a clear definition of the action space for the Q-learning algorithm. It is not clear how the learning rate is adjusted at each step. The paper only mentions that the action is the adjustment to the learning rate, but it does not specify the granularity of the adjustment or the range of possible values. For example, is the learning rate adjusted by a fixed percentage, or is it a continuous value? This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results and understand the practical implications of the proposed method.\n2. The paper does not provide a clear definition of the reward function. It is not clear how the improvement in validation performance is quantified and used as a reward signal. The paper only mentions that the reward is derived from the improvement in validation performance, but it does not specify the exact formula or how it is normalized. For instance, is the reward based on the absolute reduction in validation loss, or is it a relative improvement? The lack of a precise reward function makes it challenging to understand the learning objective of the Q-learning agent.\n3. The experimental results are not presented clearly. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the proposed approach with other methods, and the results are not statistically significant. The paper only provides the final training loss, best validation loss, and total training time, but it does not provide any information about the variance of the results or the statistical significance of the differences. This makes it difficult to assess the true performance of the proposed method and its advantages over existing approaches.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo address the lack of clarity regarding the action space, the authors should provide a detailed description of how the learning rate is adjusted at each step. This should include the granularity of the adjustment (e.g., fixed percentage, continuous value), the range of possible values, and any constraints on the learning rate. For example, they could specify that the learning rate is adjusted by multiplying it with a factor from a predefined set of values, such as {0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5}, or that the learning rate is adjusted by a continuous value within a specific range. This level of detail is crucial for reproducibility and for understanding the practical implications of the proposed method. Furthermore, the authors should justify their choice of action space and discuss how it affects the performance of the Q-learning agent. They could also consider exploring different action spaces and comparing their performance.\n\nTo clarify the reward function, the authors should provide the exact formula used to calculate the reward signal. This should include how the improvement in validation performance is quantified and normalized. For example, they could specify that the reward is the negative of the change in validation loss, or that it is the relative improvement in validation accuracy. The authors should also discuss the rationale behind their choice of reward function and how it aligns with the goal of optimizing the learning rate. They could also consider exploring different reward functions and comparing their impact on the performance of the Q-learning agent. It is important to ensure that the reward function is designed to encourage the desired behavior of the agent, such as faster convergence and better final performance.\n\nTo improve the presentation of the experimental results, the authors should provide a more detailed comparison of the proposed approach with other methods. This should include a statistical analysis of the results, such as reporting the mean and standard deviation of the performance metrics across multiple runs. The authors should also use appropriate statistical tests to determine the significance of the differences between the proposed approach and the baselines. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed description of the experimental setup, including the hyperparameters used for each method and the computational resources used for the experiments. This will allow for a more thorough evaluation of the proposed method and its advantages over existing approaches. The authors should also consider including additional metrics, such as the number of training steps required to reach a certain level of performance, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. How does the proposed approach compare to other RL-based methods for learning rate adaptation?\n2. How does the proposed approach compare to other adaptive learning rate methods, such as Adagrad, Adam, and RMSprop?\n3. What is the impact of different state representations on the performance of the RL agent?\n4. What is the impact of different reward signals on the performance of the RL agent?\n\n### Rating\n\n3: reject, not good enough\n\n### Confidence\n\n3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 3\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes a Q-learning-based approach to dynamically adapt the learning rate during transformer model training.

The authors propose a Q-learning based approach that uses the validation loss and current learning rate as the state, adjusting the learning rate to optimize the training process. The experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the RL-based learning rate adaptation leads to faster convergence and better final performance compared to traditional methods.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2 fair\n\n### Presentation\n\n2 fair\n\n### Contribution\n\n2 fair\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper introduces a novel application of Q-learning for dynamic learning rate adaptation in transformer training.\n2. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach through experiments on multiple datasets, showing improved convergence and performance.\n3. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the training dynamics and the impact of the RL agent's decisions.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The method's performance is sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and the training time can be longer due to the additional overhead of the Q-learning agent.\n2. The method may not generalize well to other types of neural network architectures without further tuning.\n3. The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the Q-learning agent.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper introduces an interesting approach using Q-learning for dynamic learning rate adjustment, but several aspects require further investigation to solidify its practical value. First, the sensitivity to hyperparameters needs a more rigorous treatment. While the authors mention this, they should provide a more detailed analysis of how different hyperparameter settings for the Q-learning agent (e.g., learning rate, discount factor, exploration strategy) affect the final performance and convergence speed. A sensitivity analysis, perhaps visualized with plots showing performance variation across a range of hyperparameter values, would be beneficial. Furthermore, the paper should explore techniques to mitigate this sensitivity, such as adaptive hyperparameter tuning or robust Q-learning algorithms. Without a clear understanding of how to select these hyperparameters, the practical applicability of the method is limited.\n\nSecond, the generalization capability of the proposed method needs more substantial evidence. The paper should include experiments on a wider range of neural network architectures, not just transformers. This could include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image tasks or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence tasks. The authors should also investigate how the Q-learning agent's state and action space might need to be adapted for different architectures. For example, the learning rate might not be the only hyperparameter that needs dynamic adjustment in other architectures. A more thorough investigation into the generalization capabilities would significantly strengthen the paper's claims. Additionally, the paper should discuss the potential limitations of the proposed approach when applied to different types of data or tasks.\n\nFinally, a detailed analysis of the computational overhead is crucial. The paper should quantify the additional time and resources required by the Q-learning agent during training. This should include a breakdown of the time spent on different operations, such as state observation, action selection, and Q-value updates. The authors should also compare the training time of the proposed method with and without the Q-learning agent, and with other adaptive learning rate techniques. This analysis should be performed on different hardware configurations to understand the scalability of the approach. Without a clear understanding of the computational cost, it is difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the proposed method, especially for large-scale models and datasets.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. How does the proposed approach compare to other RL algorithms for learning rate adaptation, such as policy gradient methods or actor-critic algorithms?\n2. How does the proposed approach generalize to other types of neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks?\n3. What is the impact of different state representations and reward signals on the performance of the RL agent?\n\n### Rating\n\n3: reject, not good enough\n\n### Confidence\n\n3: You are fairly confident in your assessment.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a Q-learning based approach to dynamically adjust the learning rate during the training of transformer models, aiming to optimize the training process by considering both the validation loss and the current learning rate as the state. The proposed method is evaluated on three datasets, demonstrating faster convergence and slightly better final performance compared to traditional static learning rate schedules. However, the paper's contributions are somewhat limited by a lack of clarity in the definition of the action space and reward function, as well as insufficient experimental comparisons with other state-of-the-art learning rate adaptation techniques. The method's sensitivity to hyperparameters and potential computational overhead are also noted as limitations. Despite these issues, the paper presents a novel application of reinforcement learning to a critical aspect of neural network training, which could have significant implications if further developed and validated.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe paper makes a valuable contribution by exploring the application of Q-learning to dynamically adjust the learning rate during transformer training. This is a novel approach that addresses a key challenge in optimizing neural network training, as traditional static learning rate schedules often fail to adapt to the non-stationary nature of the training process. The authors provide a clear and straightforward description of their method, which is easy to understand and follow. The experimental setup is well-defined, and the results show that the proposed method can lead to faster convergence and slightly better final performance compared to a static baseline. The paper also includes ablation studies that explore the impact of different initial learning rates and reward signals, providing some insights into the method's behavior. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their approach, such as the sensitivity to hyperparameters and the potential for longer training times due to the overhead of the Q-learning agent, which demonstrates a thoughtful and honest evaluation of their work. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its innovative application of reinforcement learning to learning rate adaptation, the clarity of its methodological description, and the empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness in certain scenarios.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the paper's novel contributions, several methodological and experimental weaknesses significantly impact its overall quality and the robustness of its conclusions. First, the definition of the action space for the Q-learning algorithm is not clear. The paper states that the action is an adjustment to the learning rate, which can be an increase or decrease by a certain factor, but it does not specify the granularity of this adjustment or the range of possible values. For example, it is unclear whether the learning rate is adjusted by a fixed percentage or a continuous value, and what the specific set of possible adjustment factors is. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results and understand the practical implications of the proposed method (e.g., how the learning rate is updated at each step). The authors should provide a more detailed description of the action space, including the exact values or ranges of the adjustment factors, to ensure clarity and reproducibility (Section 3.2, Section 4).\n\nSecond, the reward function is not clearly defined. The paper mentions that the reward is derived from the improvement in validation performance, specifically the reduction in validation loss, but it does not provide the exact formula used to calculate the reward. This ambiguity makes it challenging to understand the learning objective of the Q-learning agent and how it is incentivized to explore and exploit the action space. A precise mathematical formulation of the reward function, including how the improvement in validation performance is quantified and normalized, is essential for a thorough evaluation of the method (Section 3.2, Section 4).\n\nThird, the experimental results are not presented clearly, and the paper lacks a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art learning rate adaptation techniques. The results section only provides the final training loss, best validation loss, and total training time, without any information about the variance of the results or the statistical significance of the differences. This makes it difficult to assess the true performance of the proposed method and its advantages over existing approaches. Additionally, the paper does not compare the proposed method with other adaptive learning rate methods, such as Adam or RMSprop, which are commonly used in transformer training. The inclusion of these baselines would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's effectiveness (Section 5, Section 6.1).\n\nFourth, the method's performance is sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and the training time can be longer due to the additional overhead of the Q-learning agent. The paper acknowledges this sensitivity but does not provide a detailed analysis of how different hyperparameter settings affect the performance of the Q-learning agent. A sensitivity analysis, perhaps visualized with plots showing performance variation across a range of hyperparameter values, would be beneficial. Furthermore, the paper should explore techniques to mitigate this sensitivity, such as adaptive hyperparameter tuning or robust Q-learning algorithms. The computational overhead introduced by the Q-learning agent is also not thoroughly analyzed, making it difficult to evaluate the practical feasibility of the method, especially for large-scale models and datasets (Section 5, Section 6.2, Section 7).\n\nFinally, the paper's generalization capability to other types of neural network architectures is not well-supported. The experiments are conducted only on transformer models, and the paper does not provide evidence of how the proposed method performs on other architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This limited scope raises concerns about the method's applicability to a broader range of tasks and models. The authors should include experiments on different architectures and discuss how the Q-learning agent's state and action space might need to be adapted for these models (Section 5, Section 6.1, Section 7).\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses and improve the overall quality of the paper, several concrete and actionable recommendations can be made. First, the authors should provide a detailed description of the action space for the Q-learning algorithm. This should include the granularity of the learning rate adjustments, the range of possible values, and any constraints on the learning rate. For example, the authors could specify that the learning rate is adjusted by multiplying it with a factor from a predefined set of values, such as {0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5}, or that the learning rate is adjusted by a continuous value within a specific range. This level of detail is crucial for reproducibility and for understanding the practical implications of the proposed method (Section 3.2, Section 4).\n\nSecond, the reward function should be clearly defined with the exact mathematical formula used to calculate the reward signal. The authors should specify how the improvement in validation performance is quantified and normalized. For instance, they could define the reward as the negative of the change in validation loss or as the relative improvement in validation accuracy. The rationale behind the choice of reward function should be discussed, and the authors should consider exploring different reward functions to understand their impact on the performance of the Q-learning agent. This would help to ensure that the reward function is designed to encourage the desired behavior, such as faster convergence and better final performance (Section 3.2, Section 4).\n\nThird, the presentation of the experimental results should be improved. The authors should provide a more detailed comparison of the proposed approach with other state-of-the-art learning rate adaptation techniques, including other RL-based methods and established schedulers like cosine annealing with and without warmup. The results should include statistical analysis, such as reporting the mean and standard deviation of the performance metrics across multiple runs, and using appropriate statistical tests to determine the significance of the differences.

The authors propose a Q-learning based approach that uses the validation loss and current learning rate as the state, adjusting the learning rate to optimize the training process. The proposed method is evaluated on three datasets, showing comparable performance.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2 fair\n\n### Presentation\n\n1 poor\n\n### Contribution\n\n1 poor\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The proposed method is straightforward and easy to understand.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n[1] A practical guide to hyperparameter optimization in deep learning.\n\n#### comment\n\n - The experiments are very limited: the authors only compare the proposed method with the default configuration, without any other baselines or ablation studies. According to [1], the default configuration is not the optimal configuration for training transformers, and the optimal configuration could be different for different datasets. Therefore, it is unfair to compare other methods with the default configuration. Also, the authors should include other RL methods and learning rate schedulers as baselines.\n\n- The results are not very promising: the proposed method shows almost no improvement compared to the baseline configuration.\n\n- The presentation is poor: the paper is not well-written, and the figures and tables are not well-formatted. For example, the citation in line 53 is incorrect, and the tables are not properly aligned.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe experimental evaluation needs significant improvement to properly assess the proposed method's effectiveness. Comparing against only the default configuration is insufficient, as it is well-established that hyperparameter tuning can significantly impact performance, especially for transformer models. The authors should include a wider range of baselines, including other RL-based methods for learning rate adaptation, as well as established learning rate schedulers like cosine annealing with and without warmup. Furthermore, ablation studies are crucial to understand the impact of different components of the proposed Q-learning approach. For example, varying the state space, action space, and reward function could provide valuable insights into the method's sensitivity to these design choices. The experiments should also be conducted on a broader range of datasets to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method. Without these additional experiments, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the method's practical value.\n\nTo improve the presentation, the authors should focus on clarity and precision. The paper needs a thorough revision to improve the writing quality, ensuring that the ideas are conveyed clearly and concisely. The figures and tables should be formatted according to the conference guidelines, with proper alignment and spacing. Specifically, the citation in line 53 needs to be corrected, and the tables should be properly aligned with the surrounding text. The authors should also consider using more informative visualizations to illustrate the behavior of the proposed method. For example, plotting the learning rate trajectory over time for different methods could provide valuable insights into how the proposed method adapts the learning rate compared to baselines. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of the experimental setup, including the specific hyperparameters used for each method.\n\nFinally, the authors should consider exploring different reward functions for the Q-learning algorithm. The current reward function, based solely on validation loss, might not be optimal for encouraging exploration and long-term performance. For example, incorporating a reward based on the improvement in validation loss over time could encourage the agent to explore more aggressively. Additionally, the authors should consider using a more sophisticated RL algorithm, such as an actor-critic method, which might be better suited for this problem. The current Q-learning approach is relatively simple and might not be able to capture the complex dynamics of the learning rate adaptation process. Exploring these alternative approaches could lead to more significant improvements in performance.\n\n### Questions\n\n- What is the reward function for the Q-learning algorithm? According to Section 3.2, the reward is based on the improvement in validation performance, which means the agent will only decrease the learning rate, leading to very slow convergence. I think the authors meant that the reward is based on the improvement in validation loss.\n\n- In Section 6.1, the authors mention that \"The Q-learning based approach consistently outperforms the baseline in terms of validation loss and training efficiency.\" However, according to Table 1, the improvement is negligible.\n\n### Rating\n\n1: strong reject\n\n### Confidence\n\n4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.\n\n**********"

This level of detail is crucial for reproducibility and for understanding the practical implications of the proposed method. Furthermore, the authors should justify their choice of action space and discuss how it affects the performance of the Q-learning agent. They could also consider exploring different action spaces and comparing their performance.\n\nTo clarify the reward function, the authors should provide the exact formula used to calculate the reward signal.

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a Q-learning based approach to dynamically adjust the learning rate during the training of transformer models, aiming to optimize the training process by considering both the validation loss and the current learning rate as the state. The proposed method is evaluated on three datasets, demonstrating faster convergence and slightly better final performance compared to traditional static learning rate schedules. However, the paper's contributions are somewhat limited by a lack of clarity in the definition of the action space and reward function, as well as insufficient experimental comparisons with other state-of-the-art learning rate adaptation techniques. The method's sensitivity to hyperparameters and potential computational overhead are also noted as limitations. Despite these issues, the paper presents a novel application of reinforcement learning to a critical aspect of neural network training, which could have significant implications if further developed and validated.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe paper makes a valuable contribution by exploring the application of Q-learning to dynamically adjust the learning rate during transformer training. This is a novel approach that addresses a key challenge in optimizing neural network training, as traditional static learning rate schedules often fail to adapt to the non-stationary nature of the training process. The authors provide a clear and straightforward description of their method, which is easy to understand and follow. The experimental setup is well-defined, and the results show that the proposed method can lead to faster convergence and slightly better final performance compared to a static baseline. The paper also includes ablation studies that explore the impact of different initial learning rates and reward signals, providing some insights into the method's behavior. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their approach, such as the sensitivity to hyperparameters and the potential for longer training times due to the overhead of the Q-learning agent, which demonstrates a thoughtful and honest evaluation of their work. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its innovative application of reinforcement learning to learning rate adaptation, the clarity of its methodological description, and the empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness in certain scenarios.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the paper's novel contributions, several methodological and experimental weaknesses significantly impact its overall quality and the robustness of its conclusions. First, the definition of the action space for the Q-learning algorithm is not clear. The paper states that the action is an adjustment to the learning rate, which can be an increase or decrease by a certain factor, but it does not specify the granularity of this adjustment or the range of possible values. For example, it is unclear whether the learning rate is adjusted by a fixed percentage or a continuous value, and what the specific set of possible adjustment factors is. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results and understand the practical implications of the proposed method (e.g., how the learning rate is updated at each step). The authors should provide a more detailed description of the action space, including the exact values or ranges of the adjustment factors, to ensure clarity and reproducibility (Section 3.2, Section 4).\n\nSecond, the reward function is not clearly defined. The paper mentions that the reward is derived from the improvement in validation performance, specifically the reduction in validation loss, but it does not provide the exact formula used to calculate the reward. This ambiguity makes it challenging to understand the learning objective of the Q-learning agent and how it is incentivized to explore and exploit the action space. A precise mathematical formulation of the reward function, including how the improvement in validation performance is quantified and normalized, is essential for a thorough evaluation of the method (Section 3.2, Section 4).\n\nThird, the experimental results are not presented clearly, and the paper lacks a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art learning rate adaptation techniques. The results section only provides the final training loss, best validation loss, and total training time, without any information about the variance of the results or the statistical significance of the differences. This makes it difficult to assess the true performance of the proposed method and its advantages over existing approaches. Additionally, the paper does not compare the proposed method with other adaptive learning rate methods, such as Adam or RMSprop, which are commonly used in transformer training. The inclusion of these baselines would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's effectiveness (Section 5, Section 6.1).\n\nFourth, the method's performance is sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and the training time can be longer due to the additional overhead of the Q-learning agent. The paper acknowledges this sensitivity but does not provide a detailed analysis of how different hyperparameter settings affect the performance of the Q-learning agent. A sensitivity analysis, perhaps visualized with plots showing performance variation across a range of hyperparameter values, would be beneficial. Furthermore, the paper should explore techniques to mitigate this sensitivity, such as adaptive hyperparameter tuning or robust Q-learning algorithms. The computational overhead introduced by the Q-learning agent is also not thoroughly analyzed, making it difficult to evaluate the practical feasibility of the method, especially for large-scale models and datasets (Section 5, Section 6.2, Section 7).\n\nFinally, the paper's generalization capability to other types of neural network architectures is not well-supported. The experiments are conducted only on transformer models, and the paper does not provide evidence of how the proposed method performs on other architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This limited scope raises concerns about the method's applicability to a broader range of tasks and models. The authors should include experiments on different architectures and discuss how the Q-learning agent's state and action space might need to be adapted for these models (Section 5, Section 6.1, Section 7).\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses and improve the overall quality of the paper, several concrete and actionable recommendations can be made. First, the authors should provide a detailed description of the action space for the Q-learning algorithm. This should include the granularity of the learning rate adjustments, the range of possible values, and any constraints on the learning rate. For example, the authors could specify that the learning rate is adjusted by multiplying it with a factor from a predefined set of values, such as {0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5}, or that the learning rate is adjusted by a continuous value within a specific range. This level of detail is crucial for reproducibility and for understanding the practical implications of the proposed method (Section 3.2, Section 4).\n\nSecond, the reward function should be clearly defined with the exact mathematical formula used to calculate the reward signal. The authors should specify how the improvement in validation performance is quantified and normalized. For instance, they could define the reward as the negative of the change in validation loss or as the relative improvement in validation accuracy. The rationale behind the choice of reward function should be discussed, and the authors should consider exploring different reward functions to understand their impact on the performance of the Q-learning agent. This would help to ensure that the reward function is designed to encourage the desired behavior, such as faster convergence and better final performance (Section 3.2, Section 4).\n\nThird, the presentation of the experimental results should be improved. The authors should provide a more detailed comparison of the proposed approach with other state-of-the-art learning rate adaptation techniques, including other RL-based methods and established schedulers like cosine annealing with and without warmup. The results should include statistical analysis, such as reporting the mean and standard deviation of the performance metrics across multiple runs, and using appropriate statistical tests to determine the significance of the differences. The authors should also provide a more detailed description of the experimental setup, including the specific hyperparameters used for each method and the computational resources used for the experiments. This will allow for a more thorough evaluation of the proposed method and its advantages over existing approaches (Section 5, Section 6.1).\n\nFourth, the paper should include a sensitivity analysis of the Q-learning agent's hyperparameters. The authors should explore how different settings for the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate affect the performance of the agent. This analysis should be visualized with plots showing performance variation across a range of hyperparameter values. Additionally, the authors should consider using adaptive hyperparameter tuning techniques or robust Q-learning algorithms to mitigate the sensitivity to hyperparameters. This would provide a more robust and practical method for learning rate adaptation (Section 5, Section 6.2, Section 7).\n\nFinally, the authors should investigate the generalization capability of the proposed method to other types of neural network architectures. Experiments should be conducted on a wider range of models, such as CNNs for image tasks and RNNs for sequence tasks. The authors should also discuss how the Q-learning agent's state and action space might need to be adapted for different architectures. For example, the learning rate might not be the only hyperparameter that needs dynamic adjustment in other architectures. A more thorough investigation into the generalization capabilities would significantly strengthen the paper's claims and provide valuable insights into the method's broader applicability (Section 5, Section 6.1, Section 7).\n\n\n## Questions:\n\n1.

Despite these issues, the paper presents a novel application of reinforcement learning to a critical aspect of neural network training, which could have significant implications if further developed and validated.",

                "strengths": "The paper makes a valuable contribution by exploring the application of Q-learning to dynamically adjust the learning rate during transformer training. This is a novel approach that addresses a key challenge in optimizing neural network training, as traditional static learning rate schedules often fail to adapt to the non-stationary nature of the training process. The authors provide a clear and straightforward description of their method, which is easy to understand and follow. The experimental setup is well-defined, and the results show that the proposed method can lead to faster convergence and slightly better final performance compared to a static baseline. The paper also includes ablation studies that explore the impact of different initial learning rates and reward signals, providing some insights into the method's behavior. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their approach, such as the sensitivity to hyperparameters and the potential for longer training times due to the overhead of the Q-learning agent, which demonstrates a thoughtful and honest evaluation of their work. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its innovative application of reinforcement learning to learning rate adaptation, the clarity of its methodological description, and the empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness in certain scenarios.",
                "weaknesses": "Despite the paper's novel contributions, several methodological and experimental weaknesses significantly impact its overall quality and the robustness of its conclusions. First, the definition of the action space for the Q-learning algorithm is not clear. The paper states that the action is an adjustment to the learning rate, which can be an increase or decrease by a certain factor, but it does not specify the granularity of this adjustment or the range of possible values. For example, it is unclear whether the learning rate is adjusted by a fixed percentage or a continuous value, and what the specific set of possible adjustment factors is. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results and understand the practical implications of the proposed method (e.g., how the learning rate is updated at each step). The authors should provide a more detailed description of the action space, including the exact values or ranges of the adjustment factors, to ensure clarity and reproducibility (Section 3.2, Section 4).\n\nSecond, the reward function is not clearly defined. The paper mentions that the reward is derived from the improvement in validation performance, specifically the reduction in validation loss, but it does not provide the exact formula used to calculate the reward. This ambiguity makes it challenging to understand the learning objective of the Q-learning agent and how it is incentivized to explore and exploit the action space. A precise mathematical formulation of the reward function, including how the improvement in validation performance is quantified and normalized, is essential for a thorough evaluation of the method (Section 3.2, Section 4).\n\nThird, the experimental results are not presented clearly, and the paper lacks a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art learning rate adaptation techniques. The results section only provides the final training loss, best validation loss, and total training time, without any information about the variance of the results or the statistical significance of the differences. This makes it difficult to assess the true performance of the proposed method and its advantages over existing approaches. Additionally, the paper does not compare the proposed method with other adaptive learning rate methods, such as Adam or RMSprop, which are commonly used in transformer training. The inclusion of these baselines would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's effectiveness (Section 5, Section 6.1).\n\nFourth, the method's performance is sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and the training time can be longer due to the additional overhead of the Q-learning agent. The paper acknowledges this sensitivity but does not provide a detailed analysis of how different hyperparameter settings affect the performance of the Q-learning agent. A sensitivity analysis, perhaps visualized with plots showing performance variation across a range of hyperparameter values, would be beneficial. Furthermore, the paper should explore techniques to mitigate this sensitivity, such as adaptive hyperparameter tuning or robust Q-learning algorithms. The computational overhead introduced by the Q-learning agent is also not thoroughly analyzed, making it difficult to evaluate the practical feasibility of the method, especially for large-scale models and datasets (Section 5, Section 6.2, Section 7).\n\nFinally, the paper's generalization capability to other types of neural network architectures is not well-supported. The experiments are conducted only on transformer models, and the paper does not provide evidence of how the proposed method performs on other architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This limited scope raises concerns about the method's applicability to a broader range of tasks and models. The authors should include experiments on different architectures and discuss how the Q-learning agent's state and action space might need to be adapted for these models (Section 5, Section 6.1, Section 7).",
                "suggestions": "To address the identified weaknesses and improve the overall quality of the paper, several concrete and actionable recommendations can be made. First, the authors should provide a detailed description of the action space for the Q-learning algorithm. This should include the granularity of the learning rate adjustments, the range of possible values, and any constraints on the learning rate. For example, the authors could specify that the learning rate is adjusted by multiplying it with a factor from a predefined set of values, such as {0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5}, or that the learning rate is adjusted by a continuous value within a specific range. This level of detail is crucial for reproducibility and for understanding the practical implications of the proposed method (Section 3.2, Section 4).\n\nSecond, the reward function should be clearly defined with the exact mathematical formula used to calculate the reward signal. The authors should specify how the improvement in validation performance is quantified and normalized. For instance, they could define the reward as the negative of the change in validation loss or as the relative improvement in validation accuracy. The rationale behind the choice of reward function should be discussed, and the authors should consider exploring different reward functions to understand their impact on the performance of the Q-learning agent. This would help to ensure that the reward function is designed to encourage the desired behavior, such as faster convergence and better final performance (Section 3.2, Section 4).\n\nThird, the presentation of the experimental results should be improved. The authors should provide a more detailed comparison of the proposed approach with other state-of-the-art learning rate adaptation techniques, including other RL-based methods and established schedulers like cosine annealing with and without warmup. The results should include statistical analysis, such as reporting the mean and standard deviation of the performance metrics across multiple runs, and using appropriate statistical tests to determine the significance of the differences. The authors should also provide a more detailed description of the experimental setup, including the specific hyperparameters used for each method and the computational resources used for the experiments. This will allow for a more thorough evaluation of the proposed method and its advantages over existing approaches (Section 5, Section 6.1).\n\nFourth, the paper should include a sensitivity analysis of the Q-learning agent's hyperparameters. The authors should explore how different settings for the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate affect the performance of the agent. This analysis should be visualized with plots showing performance variation across a range of hyperparameter values. Additionally, the authors should consider using adaptive hyperparameter tuning techniques or robust Q-learning algorithms to mitigate the sensitivity to hyperparameters. This would provide a more robust and practical method for learning rate adaptation (Section 5, Section 6.2, Section 7).\n\nFinally, the authors should investigate the generalization capability of the proposed method to other types of neural network architectures. Experiments should be conducted on a wider range of models, such as CNNs for image tasks and RNNs for sequence tasks. The authors should also discuss how the Q-learning agent's state and action space might need to be adapted for different architectures. For example, the learning rate might not be the only hyperparameter that needs dynamic adjustment in other architectures. A more thorough investigation into the generalization capabilities would significantly strengthen the paper's claims and provide valuable insights into the method's broader applicability (Section 5, Section 6.1, Section 7).",

The authors propose a gating mechanism that dynamically combines the outputs of two specialized expert networks, allowing the model to capture complex multi-modal distributions more effectively. They also introduce a diversity loss term to encourage the model to learn diverse modes of the data distribution. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on various 2D datasets.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n2\n\n### Contribution\n\n1\n\n### Strengths\n\n- While the idea of using multiple experts is not new, the specific application of a dual-expert architecture with a dynamic gating mechanism in the context of low-dimensional diffusion models is interesting.\n- The authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their method on four 2D datasets, providing both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments of the generated samples.\n- The code is provided for reproducibility.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n - The method is only evaluated on simple 2D datasets which are not representative of the types of data that diffusion models are typically applied to. The authors should consider evaluating their method on higher-dimensional datasets to demonstrate its scalability and practical relevance.\n- The diversity loss term is not well-motivated and its effectiveness is not thoroughly analyzed. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of why this loss term is expected to improve performance and conduct ablation studies to assess its contribution.\n- The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the gating mechanism's behavior. The authors should provide more insights into how the gating weights are determined and how they vary across different datasets and diffusion timesteps.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe primary weakness of this paper lies in the limited scope of its experimental evaluation. While the authors demonstrate improvements on 2D datasets, the practical relevance of these results is questionable given that diffusion models are typically applied to high-dimensional data such as images, audio, and text. The authors should evaluate their method on at least one higher-dimensional dataset to demonstrate its scalability and potential for real-world applications. For example, they could consider using a benchmark dataset like MNIST or CIFAR-10, which are widely used in the diffusion model literature. This would provide a more convincing demonstration of the method's capabilities and allow for a more meaningful comparison with existing approaches. Furthermore, the authors should analyze the computational cost of their method in higher dimensions, as the dual-expert architecture may introduce additional overhead compared to single-expert models. This analysis should include both training and inference time, as well as memory requirements.\n\nThe motivation for the diversity loss term is not sufficiently clear, and its impact on the results is not well-understood. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of why minimizing the mean pairwise distance between noise predictions is expected to encourage mode capture. It is not immediately obvious how this loss term relates to the diversity of the generated samples. A more rigorous justification, possibly with theoretical insights, would be beneficial. Additionally, the authors should conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of the diversity loss term. This should include comparing the performance of the model with and without the diversity loss, as well as varying the weight of the loss term. This would help to determine the optimal value for the hyperparameter and provide a better understanding of the loss term's effectiveness. The authors should also analyze the impact of the diversity loss on the quality of the generated samples, as it is possible that minimizing the pairwise distance could lead to a degradation in sample quality.\n\nFinally, the paper lacks a thorough analysis of the gating mechanism's behavior. The authors should provide more insights into how the gating weights are determined and how they vary across different datasets and diffusion timesteps. For example, they could visualize the gating weights as a function of the input data and the diffusion timestep. This would help to understand how the model is combining the outputs of the two expert networks. The authors should also analyze the sensitivity of the model's performance to the gating mechanism. For example, they could compare the performance of the model with a fixed gating mechanism to the performance of the model with the dynamic gating mechanism. This would help to determine the importance of the dynamic gating mechanism and provide a better understanding of its role in the model's performance.\n\n### Questions\n\n- How does the performance of your method compare to other approaches for improving mode capture in generative models, such as using a mixture of Gaussians prior or hierarchical variational autoencoders?

Specifically, the current evaluation is limited to only four 2D datasets, which are not sufficient to demonstrate the generalizability of the method. To address this, the authors should include a wider range of datasets, varying in complexity and modality. For instance, incorporating datasets with more complex geometric structures or higher dimensionality would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's capabilities. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to include datasets that are known to be challenging for diffusion models, such as those with highly multimodal distributions or those with significant noise. This would help to better understand the limitations of the proposed approach and identify areas for future improvement. The inclusion of such diverse datasets would greatly enhance the credibility and impact of the paper.\n\nIn addition to expanding the dataset diversity, the paper would also benefit from a more thorough comparison with state-of-the-art diffusion models. The current evaluation lacks a comparison with more advanced models, making it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors should consider comparing their approach with recent diffusion models that have demonstrated strong performance on similar tasks. This would provide a clearer understanding of the advantages and limitations of the proposed dual-expert architecture. For example, comparing against models that utilize different denoising strategies or those that incorporate more sophisticated architectural designs would be highly informative. Furthermore, the comparison should not only focus on quantitative metrics but also include qualitative analysis of the generated samples. This would allow for a more nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method.\n\nFinally, the paper needs to provide a more detailed discussion of the computational cost and scalability of the proposed method. The current lack of information on computational resources makes it difficult to assess the practical applicability of the method.

The approach uses a gating mechanism to dynamically combine two specialized expert networks, improving the model's ability to capture complex, multi-modal distributions.

The paper does not adequately address the potential scalability of the method to higher-dimensional data. Further discussion on how the method might perform with increased dimensionality would strengthen the paper's contribution.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo strengthen the empirical validation of DualDiff, the authors should expand their experiments to include a more diverse set of datasets. Specifically, incorporating datasets with varying levels of complexity and modality would provide a more robust assessment of the method's generalizability. For example, datasets with more intricate geometric structures or those exhibiting more pronounced multi-modality would be valuable additions. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to include datasets that are commonly used in the diffusion model literature to facilitate direct comparisons with other methods. This would allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of DualDiff in different scenarios. The current set of four 2D datasets, while useful for initial validation, is not sufficient to demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed approach.\n\nIn addition to expanding the dataset diversity, the authors should also compare their method against more advanced diffusion models. While the comparison to a single-network denoiser is a good starting point, it does not fully capture the state-of-the-art in diffusion modeling. Comparing against models that incorporate techniques such as attention mechanisms or more sophisticated noise schedules would provide a more rigorous evaluation of DualDiff's performance. This would help to clarify whether the observed improvements are due to the dual-expert architecture itself or simply a result of using a more basic baseline. Furthermore, it would be valuable to analyze the performance of DualDiff in comparison to other methods designed to handle multi-modality, even if they are not specifically designed for low-dimensional data. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's relative strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost and scalability of their method. This should include a discussion of the number of parameters, training time, and inference time for DualDiff compared to the baseline model. Furthermore, it would be valuable to discuss the potential challenges of scaling the method to higher-dimensional data. For example, the authors could discuss how the number of parameters and computational cost would increase with dimensionality and what strategies could be employed to mitigate these issues. This would provide a more complete picture of the practical applicability of DualDiff and its potential for use in real-world applications. Without this information, it is difficult to assess the practical value of the proposed method.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

The experimental results are limited to simple 2D datasets, which may not fully demonstrate the method's effectiveness on more complex, real-world data. The datasets used, while illustrative, lack the high dimensionality and intricate dependencies found in many practical applications of diffusion models. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed approach to more challenging scenarios.\n2. The paper does not provide sufficient analysis of the computational cost associated with the dual-expert architecture. While the method introduces a novel approach, the practical implications of increased computational overhead are not addressed. Specifically, the paper lacks a detailed breakdown of the training and inference time, as well as memory requirements, compared to a standard single-expert diffusion model. This makes it difficult to assess the trade-off between performance gains and computational resources.\n3. The diversity loss term is not well-motivated and its effectiveness is not thoroughly analyzed. The paper introduces a diversity loss term to encourage mode capture, but the specific form of this loss and its impact on the overall training dynamics are not clearly explained. There is a lack of ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of this term, and it is unclear how the hyperparameter controlling the strength of this loss is chosen. Furthermore, the potential for this loss to introduce instability or bias in the training process is not discussed.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo strengthen the paper, the authors should first address the limitations of the experimental setup by including evaluations on more complex, higher-dimensional datasets. This could involve using datasets with more intricate structures or those that are commonly used in the diffusion model literature.

This would provide a more robust evaluation of the method's effectiveness and its ability to generalize to real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with their dual-expert architecture. This should include a breakdown of the training and inference time, as well as memory requirements, compared to a standard single-expert diffusion model. This analysis should be performed on the same hardware and with the same experimental setup to ensure a fair comparison. The authors should also investigate the scalability of their method with respect to the number of experts and the dimensionality of the data. This would provide valuable insights into the practical applicability of their approach.\n\nSecondly, the authors should provide a more thorough analysis of the diversity loss term. This should include a clear explanation of the motivation behind the specific form of the loss function and its impact on the overall training dynamics. The authors should conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of this term and to investigate its sensitivity to the hyperparameter controlling its strength. This analysis should also include a discussion of the potential for this loss to introduce instability or bias in the training process. The authors should also consider comparing their diversity loss with other existing techniques for encouraging mode coverage in generative models. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of their approach. The authors should also provide a more detailed explanation of how the gating mechanism is implemented and how it contributes to the overall performance of the model.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces DualDiff, a novel dual-expert denoising architecture designed to enhance the performance of diffusion models, particularly in low-dimensional data settings. The core idea revolves around employing two specialized expert networks, each potentially focusing on different modes of the data distribution, and dynamically combining their outputs using a gating mechanism. This gating mechanism, driven by a neural network, adaptively weighs the contributions of each expert based on the input data and the diffusion timestep. The authors also incorporate a diversity loss term, intended to encourage the model to capture a broader range of data modes, thereby improving sample diversity. The empirical evaluation of DualDiff is conducted on four 2D datasets: 'circle', 'dino', 'line', and 'moons'. These datasets, while varying in complexity, are all low-dimensional and serve as a testbed for the proposed architecture. The results presented in the paper demonstrate that DualDiff achieves improvements in KL divergence, sample diversity, and the visual quality of generated samples compared to a baseline single-expert denoiser. Specifically, the authors report a 38.7% reduction in KL divergence on the 'dino' dataset, which is highlighted as a significant improvement. The paper also includes an ablation study to assess the contribution of the diversity loss term. Overall, the paper presents a conceptually interesting approach to improving diffusion models in low-dimensional settings, with a focus on capturing multi-modal distributions through a dual-expert architecture. However, as I will discuss in detail, the paper's limitations in experimental scope and analysis significantly impact the generalizability and practical relevance of the proposed method.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe primary strength of this paper lies in its introduction of a novel dual-expert denoising architecture for diffusion models, specifically tailored for low-dimensional data. The concept of using two specialized expert networks, dynamically combined through a gating mechanism, is a conceptually interesting approach to address the challenges of modeling multi-modal distributions. This architecture allows the model to potentially specialize each expert on different modes of the data, which is a departure from the typical single-network approach. The gating mechanism, which adaptively weighs the contributions of each expert based on the input and timestep, adds a layer of flexibility and allows the model to dynamically adjust its behavior. Furthermore, the inclusion of a diversity loss term, while not without its issues, demonstrates an attempt to explicitly encourage the model to capture a broader range of data modes, which is a relevant goal for generative modeling. The paper also provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed method, including detailed descriptions of the architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics. The experimental results, while limited in scope, do show consistent improvements over the baseline model across the four 2D datasets, particularly for the 'dino' dataset, which is described as complex. The authors also provide an ablation study to assess the contribution of the diversity loss term, which is a good practice. Finally, the authors have made their code available, which is a positive step towards reproducibility. These aspects of the paper, particularly the novel architecture and the clear presentation, make it a valuable contribution to the field, despite the limitations I will discuss.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting approach, several weaknesses significantly limit its impact and generalizability. First and foremost, the experimental evaluation is severely limited in scope. The authors conduct experiments on only four 2D datasets: 'circle', 'dino', 'line', and 'moons' (Section 5). These datasets, while useful for initial validation, are not representative of the types of data that diffusion models are typically applied to. As noted by all four reviewers, diffusion models are often used for high-dimensional data such as images, audio, and text. The lack of experiments on more complex, higher-dimensional datasets raises serious concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method. The paper does not provide any justification for why these four datasets are sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of DualDiff in broader contexts. This limitation is further compounded by the lack of comparison with more advanced diffusion models. The authors compare their method against a baseline single-network denoiser with similar capacity (Section 5), but they do not compare against state-of-the-art diffusion models that have demonstrated strong performance on similar tasks. This makes it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of DualDiff and its advantages over existing approaches. The absence of such comparisons, as highlighted by multiple reviewers, makes it hard to determine whether the observed improvements are due to the dual-expert architecture itself or simply a result of using a more basic baseline. Furthermore, the paper lacks a thorough analysis of the computational cost associated with the proposed method. While the authors report training and inference times (Table 1, Section 6), they do not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational resources required, such as the number of parameters, FLOPs, or memory usage. This lack of analysis, as pointed out by multiple reviewers, makes it difficult to assess the practical applicability of DualDiff. The paper does not discuss how the computational cost of the dual-expert architecture compares to a standard single-expert diffusion model, which is a crucial consideration for practical use. The paper also does not adequately address the potential scalability of the method to higher-dimensional data. The authors acknowledge that their focus is on low-dimensional settings (Section 1), and they suggest investigating scalability to higher dimensions as future work (Section 7). However, this lack of discussion about the potential challenges and adaptations needed for higher-dimensional data is a significant limitation. The paper does not provide any insights into how the architecture or training process might need to be modified to handle the increased dimensionality, which is a critical aspect for the broader applicability of the method. Finally, while the authors introduce a diversity loss term to encourage mode capture, its motivation and effectiveness are not thoroughly analyzed. The diversity loss is defined in Equation 5 as  _Ldiversity(θ) = −Ext,t[mean(pairwise_distance(ϵθ(xt, t)))]_ (Section 4), and the motivation is stated as \"To further encourage the capture of multiple modes in the data distribution.\" (Section 4). However, the paper does not provide a detailed explanation of why minimizing the mean pairwise distance between noise predictions is expected to achieve this goal. While an ablation study is presented in Table 2, it does not fully address the concerns about the potential for this loss to introduce instability or bias in the training process. The paper also lacks a thorough analysis of the gating mechanism's behavior. While the gating mechanism is described in Equation 3 and some visualization of gating weights is provided in Figure 5 and Figure 4, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the gating weights are determined and how they vary across different datasets and diffusion timesteps. This lack of analysis limits the understanding of how the model is combining the outputs of the two expert networks and the role of the dynamic gating mechanism. In summary, the limitations in experimental scope, lack of comparison with advanced models, insufficient computational analysis, and inadequate discussion of scalability and the diversity loss term significantly weaken the paper's conclusions and practical relevance. My confidence in these identified weaknesses is high, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and have been independently validated by multiple reviewers.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First and foremost, the authors must significantly expand the experimental evaluation of DualDiff. This should include incorporating a wider range of datasets, varying in complexity, modality, and dimensionality. Specifically, the authors should include datasets that are commonly used in the diffusion model literature, such as MNIST or CIFAR-10, to facilitate direct comparisons with other methods. This would provide a more robust assessment of the method's generalizability and its ability to handle more complex data distributions. Furthermore, the authors should include datasets that are known to be challenging for diffusion models, such as those with highly multimodal distributions or those with significant noise. This would help to better understand the limitations of the proposed approach and identify areas for future improvement. In addition to expanding the dataset diversity, the authors should also compare their method against more advanced diffusion models. This should include models that incorporate techniques such as attention mechanisms or more sophisticated noise schedules. Comparing against these models would provide a more rigorous evaluation of DualDiff's performance and help to clarify its advantages and limitations. The comparison should not only focus on quantitative metrics but also include qualitative analysis of the generated samples. This would allow for a more nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with their dual-expert architecture. This should include a breakdown of the training and inference time, as well as memory requirements, compared to a standard single-expert diffusion model. This analysis should be performed on the same hardware and with the same experimental setup to ensure a fair comparison. The authors should also investigate the scalability of their method with respect to the number of experts and the dimensionality of the data. This would provide valuable insights into the practical applicability of their approach. The authors should also provide a more thorough analysis of the diversity loss term. This should include a clear explanation of the motivation behind the specific form of the loss function and its impact on the overall training dynamics. The authors should conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of this term and to investigate its sensitivity to the hyperparameter controlling its strength. This analysis should also include a discussion of the potential for this loss to introduce instability or bias in the training process. The authors should also consider comparing their diversity loss with other existing techniques for encouraging mode coverage in generative models. Finally, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the gating mechanism. This should include a visualization of the gating weights and an analysis of how they change during the training process. The authors should also investigate the sensitivity of the model's performance to the architecture of the gating network and the hyperparameters used in the training process. This would provide valuable insights into the robustness of the method and its ability to generalize to different settings. The authors should also consider comparing their gating mechanism with other existing techniques for combining the outputs of multiple experts. By addressing these points, the authors can significantly strengthen the paper and make a more compelling case for the practical relevance of their proposed method.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, several key questions remain unanswered. First, how does the performance of DualDiff scale with the complexity of the data distribution? Are there any limitations in terms of the types of distributions it can effectively model? This is a critical question given the limited scope of the experimental evaluation. Second, can the authors provide more insights into the behavior of the gating mechanism? How does it decide which expert network to rely on more heavily for different regions of the data space? A more detailed analysis of the gating mechanism's behavior is needed to understand how the model is combining the outputs of the two expert networks. Third, what are the potential challenges of applying DualDiff to higher-dimensional data? How might the architecture and training process need to be adapted for such cases? This is a crucial question for the broader applicability of the method. Fourth, how does the performance of DualDiff compare to other approaches for improving mode capture in generative models, such as using a mixture of Gaussians prior or hierarchical variational autoencoders? While these are not diffusion models, it is important to compare against the best available methods. Fifth, what is the computational overhead of the proposed dual-expert architecture compared to a single-network denoiser? A detailed analysis of the training and inference time, as well as memory requirements, is needed to assess the practical applicability of the method. Sixth, how sensitive is the performance of DualDiff to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the weight of the diversity loss term and the architecture of the expert networks? A sensitivity analysis of these hyperparameters is needed to understand the robustness of the method. Finally, what are the limitations of the proposed approach? What are the potential challenges of applying the method to higher-dimensional data and the limitations of using only two expert networks? A more thorough discussion of the limitations is needed to provide a balanced assessment of the method's potential. These questions target core methodological choices and assumptions, and addressing them would significantly strengthen the paper.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n4.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

While the authors demonstrate improvements on 2D datasets, the practical relevance of these results is questionable given that diffusion models are typically applied to high-dimensional data such as images, audio, and text. The authors should evaluate their method on at least one higher-dimensional dataset to demonstrate its scalability and potential for real-world applications. For example, they could consider using a benchmark dataset like MNIST or CIFAR-10, which are widely used in the diffusion model literature. This would provide a more convincing demonstration of the method's capabilities and allow for a more meaningful comparison with existing approaches. Furthermore, the authors should analyze the computational cost of their method in higher dimensions, as the dual-expert architecture may introduce additional overhead compared to single-expert models. This analysis should include both training and inference time, as well as memory requirements.\n\nThe motivation for the diversity loss term is not sufficiently clear, and its impact on the results is not well-understood. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of why minimizing the mean pairwise distance between noise predictions is expected to encourage mode capture. It is not immediately obvious how this loss term relates to the diversity of the generated samples. A more rigorous justification, possibly with theoretical insights, would be beneficial. Additionally, the authors should conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of the diversity loss term. This should include comparing the performance of the model with and without the diversity loss, as well as varying the weight of the loss term. This would help to determine the optimal value for the hyperparameter and provide a better understanding of the loss term's effectiveness. The authors should also analyze the impact of the diversity loss on the quality of the generated samples, as it is possible that minimizing the pairwise distance could lead to a degradation in sample quality.\n\nFinally, the paper lacks a thorough analysis of the gating mechanism's behavior. The authors should provide more insights into how the gating weights are determined and how they vary across different datasets and diffusion timesteps. For example, they could visualize the gating weights as a function of the input data and the diffusion timestep. This would help to understand how the model is combining the outputs of the two expert networks. The authors should also analyze the sensitivity of the model's performance to the gating mechanism. For example, they could compare the performance of the model with a fixed gating mechanism to the performance of the model with the dynamic gating mechanism. This would help to determine the importance of the dynamic gating mechanism and provide a better understanding of its role in the model's performance.\n\n### Questions\n\n- How does the performance of your method compare to other approaches for improving mode capture in generative models, such as using a mixture of Gaussians prior or hierarchical variational autoencoders?

Furthermore, it would be beneficial to include datasets that are commonly used in the diffusion model literature to facilitate direct comparisons with other methods.

While the comparison to a single-network denoiser is a good starting point, it does not fully capture the state-of-the-art in diffusion modeling. Comparing against models that incorporate techniques such as attention mechanisms or more sophisticated noise schedules would provide a more rigorous evaluation of DualDiff's performance. This would help to clarify whether the observed improvements are due to the dual-expert architecture itself or simply a result of using a more basic baseline. Furthermore, it would be valuable to analyze the performance of DualDiff in comparison to other methods designed to handle multi-modality, even if they are not specifically designed for low-dimensional data. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's relative strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost and scalability of their method. This should include a discussion of the number of parameters, training time, and inference time for DualDiff compared to the baseline model. Furthermore, it would be valuable to discuss the potential challenges of scaling the method to higher-dimensional data. For example, the authors could discuss how the number of parameters and computational cost would increase with dimensionality and what strategies could be employed to mitigate these issues.

The experimental results are limited to simple 2D datasets, which may not fully demonstrate the method's effectiveness on more complex, real-world data. The datasets used, while illustrative, lack the high dimensionality and intricate dependencies found in many practical applications of diffusion models. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed approach to more challenging scenarios.\n2. The paper does not provide sufficient analysis of the computational cost associated with the dual-expert architecture. While the method introduces a novel approach, the practical implications of increased computational overhead are not addressed. Specifically, the paper lacks a detailed breakdown of the training and inference time, as well as memory requirements, compared to a standard single-expert diffusion model. This makes it difficult to assess the trade-off between performance gains and computational resources.\n3. The diversity loss term is not well-motivated and its effectiveness is not thoroughly analyzed. The paper introduces a diversity loss term to encourage mode capture, but the specific form of this loss and its impact on the overall training dynamics are not clearly explained. There is a lack of ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of this term, and it is unclear how the hyperparameter controlling the strength of this loss is chosen. Furthermore, the potential for this loss to introduce instability or bias in the training process is not discussed.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo strengthen the paper, the authors should first address the limitations of the experimental setup by including evaluations on more complex, higher-dimensional datasets. This could involve using datasets with more intricate structures or those that are commonly used in the diffusion model literature.

Furthermore, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with their dual-expert architecture. This should include a breakdown of the training and inference time, as well as memory requirements, compared to a standard single-expert diffusion model. This analysis should be performed on the same hardware and with the same experimental setup to ensure a fair comparison. The authors should also investigate the scalability of their method with respect to the number of experts and the dimensionality of the data. This would provide valuable insights into the practical applicability of their approach.\n\nSecondly, the authors should provide a more thorough analysis of the diversity loss term. This should include a clear explanation of the motivation behind the specific form of the loss function and its impact on the overall training dynamics. The authors should conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of this term and to investigate its sensitivity to the hyperparameter controlling its strength. This analysis should also include a discussion of the potential for this loss to introduce instability or bias in the training process. The authors should also consider comparing their diversity loss with other existing techniques for encouraging mode coverage in generative models.

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces DualDiff, a novel dual-expert denoising architecture designed to enhance the performance of diffusion models, particularly in low-dimensional data settings. The core idea revolves around employing two specialized expert networks, each potentially focusing on different modes of the data distribution, and dynamically combining their outputs using a gating mechanism. This gating mechanism, driven by a neural network, adaptively weighs the contributions of each expert based on the input data and the diffusion timestep. The authors also incorporate a diversity loss term, intended to encourage the model to capture a broader range of data modes, thereby improving sample diversity. The empirical evaluation of DualDiff is conducted on four 2D datasets: 'circle', 'dino', 'line', and 'moons'. These datasets, while varying in complexity, are all low-dimensional and serve as a testbed for the proposed architecture. The results presented in the paper demonstrate that DualDiff achieves improvements in KL divergence, sample diversity, and the visual quality of generated samples compared to a baseline single-expert denoiser. Specifically, the authors report a 38.7% reduction in KL divergence on the 'dino' dataset, which is highlighted as a significant improvement. The paper also includes an ablation study to assess the contribution of the diversity loss term. Overall, the paper presents a conceptually interesting approach to improving diffusion models in low-dimensional settings, with a focus on capturing multi-modal distributions through a dual-expert architecture. However, as I will discuss in detail, the paper's limitations in experimental scope and analysis significantly impact the generalizability and practical relevance of the proposed method.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe primary strength of this paper lies in its introduction of a novel dual-expert denoising architecture for diffusion models, specifically tailored for low-dimensional data. The concept of using two specialized expert networks, dynamically combined through a gating mechanism, is a conceptually interesting approach to address the challenges of modeling multi-modal distributions. This architecture allows the model to potentially specialize each expert on different modes of the data, which is a departure from the typical single-network approach. The gating mechanism, which adaptively weighs the contributions of each expert based on the input and timestep, adds a layer of flexibility and allows the model to dynamically adjust its behavior. Furthermore, the inclusion of a diversity loss term, while not without its issues, demonstrates an attempt to explicitly encourage the model to capture a broader range of data modes, which is a relevant goal for generative modeling. The paper also provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed method, including detailed descriptions of the architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics. The experimental results, while limited in scope, do show consistent improvements over the baseline model across the four 2D datasets, particularly for the 'dino' dataset, which is described as complex. The authors also provide an ablation study to assess the contribution of the diversity loss term, which is a good practice. Finally, the authors have made their code available, which is a positive step towards reproducibility. These aspects of the paper, particularly the novel architecture and the clear presentation, make it a valuable contribution to the field, despite the limitations I will discuss.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting approach, several weaknesses significantly limit its impact and generalizability. First and foremost, the experimental evaluation is severely limited in scope. The authors conduct experiments on only four 2D datasets: 'circle', 'dino', 'line', and 'moons' (Section 5). These datasets, while useful for initial validation, are not representative of the types of data that diffusion models are typically applied to. As noted by all four reviewers, diffusion models are often used for high-dimensional data such as images, audio, and text. The lack of experiments on more complex, higher-dimensional datasets raises serious concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method. The paper does not provide any justification for why these four datasets are sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of DualDiff in broader contexts. This limitation is further compounded by the lack of comparison with more advanced diffusion models. The authors compare their method against a baseline single-network denoiser with similar capacity (Section 5), but they do not compare against state-of-the-art diffusion models that have demonstrated strong performance on similar tasks. This makes it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of DualDiff and its advantages over existing approaches. The absence of such comparisons, as highlighted by multiple reviewers, makes it hard to determine whether the observed improvements are due to the dual-expert architecture itself or simply a result of using a more basic baseline. Furthermore, the paper lacks a thorough analysis of the computational cost associated with the proposed method. While the authors report training and inference times (Table 1, Section 6), they do not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational resources required, such as the number of parameters, FLOPs, or memory usage. This lack of analysis, as pointed out by multiple reviewers, makes it difficult to assess the practical applicability of DualDiff. The paper does not discuss how the computational cost of the dual-expert architecture compares to a standard single-expert diffusion model, which is a crucial consideration for practical use. The paper also does not adequately address the potential scalability of the method to higher-dimensional data. The authors acknowledge that their focus is on low-dimensional settings (Section 1), and they suggest investigating scalability to higher dimensions as future work (Section 7). However, this lack of discussion about the potential challenges and adaptations needed for higher-dimensional data is a significant limitation. The paper does not provide any insights into how the architecture or training process might need to be modified to handle the increased dimensionality, which is a critical aspect for the broader applicability of the method. Finally, while the authors introduce a diversity loss term to encourage mode capture, its motivation and effectiveness are not thoroughly analyzed. The diversity loss is defined in Equation 5 as  _Ldiversity(θ) = −Ext,t[mean(pairwise_distance(ϵθ(xt, t)))]_ (Section 4), and the motivation is stated as \"To further encourage the capture of multiple modes in the data distribution.\" (Section 4). However, the paper does not provide a detailed explanation of why minimizing the mean pairwise distance between noise predictions is expected to achieve this goal. While an ablation study is presented in Table 2, it does not fully address the concerns about the potential for this loss to introduce instability or bias in the training process. The paper also lacks a thorough analysis of the gating mechanism's behavior. While the gating mechanism is described in Equation 3 and some visualization of gating weights is provided in Figure 5 and Figure 4, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the gating weights are determined and how they vary across different datasets and diffusion timesteps. This lack of analysis limits the understanding of how the model is combining the outputs of the two expert networks and the role of the dynamic gating mechanism. In summary, the limitations in experimental scope, lack of comparison with advanced models, insufficient computational analysis, and inadequate discussion of scalability and the diversity loss term significantly weaken the paper's conclusions and practical relevance. My confidence in these identified weaknesses is high, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and have been independently validated by multiple reviewers.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First and foremost, the authors must significantly expand the experimental evaluation of DualDiff. This should include incorporating a wider range of datasets, varying in complexity, modality, and dimensionality. Specifically, the authors should include datasets that are commonly used in the diffusion model literature, such as MNIST or CIFAR-10, to facilitate direct comparisons with other methods. This would provide a more robust assessment of the method's generalizability and its ability to handle more complex data distributions. Furthermore, the authors should include datasets that are known to be challenging for diffusion models, such as those with highly multimodal distributions or those with significant noise. This would help to better understand the limitations of the proposed approach and identify areas for future improvement. In addition to expanding the dataset diversity, the authors should also compare their method against more advanced diffusion models. This should include models that incorporate techniques such as attention mechanisms or more sophisticated noise schedules. Comparing against these models would provide a more rigorous evaluation of DualDiff's performance and help to clarify its advantages and limitations. The comparison should not only focus on quantitative metrics but also include qualitative analysis of the generated samples. This would allow for a more nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with their dual-expert architecture. This should include a breakdown of the training and inference time, as well as memory requirements, compared to a standard single-expert diffusion model. This analysis should be performed on the same hardware and with the same experimental setup to ensure a fair comparison. The authors should also investigate the scalability of their method with respect to the number of experts and the dimensionality of the data.

The authors should also consider comparing their gating mechanism with other existing techniques for combining the outputs of multiple experts. By addressing these points, the authors can significantly strengthen the paper and make a more compelling case for the practical relevance of their proposed method.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, several key questions remain unanswered. First, how does the performance of DualDiff scale with the complexity of the data distribution? Are there any limitations in terms of the types of distributions it can effectively model? This is a critical question given the limited scope of the experimental evaluation. Second, can the authors provide more insights into the behavior of the gating mechanism? How does it decide which expert network to rely on more heavily for different regions of the data space? A more detailed analysis of the gating mechanism's behavior is needed to understand how the model is combining the outputs of the two expert networks. Third, what are the potential challenges of applying DualDiff to higher-dimensional data? How might the architecture and training process need to be adapted for such cases? This is a crucial question for the broader applicability of the method. Fourth, how does the performance of DualDiff compare to other approaches for improving mode capture in generative models, such as using a mixture of Gaussians prior or hierarchical variational autoencoders? While these are not diffusion models, it is important to compare against the best available methods. Fifth, what is the computational overhead of the proposed dual-expert architecture compared to a single-network denoiser? A detailed analysis of the training and inference time, as well as memory requirements, is needed to assess the practical applicability of the method. Sixth, how sensitive is the performance of DualDiff to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the weight of the diversity loss term and the architecture of the expert networks?

What are the potential challenges of applying the method to higher-dimensional data and the limitations of using only two expert networks? A more thorough discussion of the limitations is needed to provide a balanced assessment of the method's potential. These questions target core methodological choices and assumptions, and addressing them would significantly strengthen the paper.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n4.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",

The approach combines coarse and fine grids to adjust noise levels dynamically during the diffusion process, with L1 regularization to encourage sparsity. The method is evaluated on four 2D datasets, showing improvements in sample quality and distribution matching compared to standard diffusion models.\n\n### Soundness\n\n1\n\n### Presentation\n\n1\n\n### Contribution\n\n1\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper addresses the unique challenges of using diffusion models for low-dimensional data, which is an underexplored area with potential applications in various domains such as scientific simulation and financial modeling. The introduction of a multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism is a novel approach to improve diffusion models' performance on low-dimensional datasets.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\nThe experimental setup is highly simplified, with all experiments conducted on mere 2D datasets, making the conclusions less convincing. The paper lacks a demonstration of the method's effectiveness on real-world applications or more complex datasets, which limits its practical relevance. The method is also not compared against any SOTA models, making it difficult to assess its relative performance. The lack of a clear explanation of the motivation behind the proposed method and its connection to the challenges of low-dimensional data further weakens the paper. Additionally, the paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the impact of different grid sizes or the choice of regularization parameter, which are important hyperparameters for the proposed method. The paper also lacks a discussion of the computational cost of the proposed method compared to standard diffusion models, which is an important consideration for practical applications. Finally, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the noise adaptation mechanism is implemented in the reverse process, which is crucial for understanding the method's effectiveness.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper needs to significantly expand its experimental validation to include more complex and realistic datasets. While the use of 2D datasets is a good starting point for initial validation, it is not sufficient to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method. The authors should consider including experiments on higher-dimensional datasets, such as those found in real-world scientific simulations or financial modeling. Furthermore, the paper should include a comparison against state-of-the-art generative models, not just standard diffusion models, to properly contextualize the performance of the proposed method. This would involve benchmarking against models that are known to perform well on similar types of data, even if they are not specifically designed for low-dimensional data. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nTo address the lack of clarity regarding the motivation and implementation of the proposed method, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of how the multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism addresses the specific challenges of low-dimensional data. This should include a discussion of why standard noise scheduling techniques are insufficient for low-dimensional data and how the proposed method overcomes these limitations. The authors should also provide a more detailed explanation of how the noise adaptation mechanism is implemented in the reverse process, including the specific mathematical equations and algorithmic steps involved. This would help to clarify the method's effectiveness and make it easier for other researchers to reproduce the results. Additionally, the authors should conduct a more thorough analysis of the impact of different grid sizes and the choice of regularization parameter, including a sensitivity analysis to determine the optimal hyperparameter settings.\n\nFinally, the paper should include a discussion of the computational cost of the proposed method compared to standard diffusion models. This should include an analysis of the time and memory requirements of the method, as well as a discussion of any potential trade-offs between performance and computational cost. This would be important for practical applications where computational resources may be limited. The authors should also consider providing a more detailed analysis of the method's limitations and potential areas for future research. This would help to provide a more balanced and comprehensive assessment of the method's contributions.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Why are all experiments conducted only on simple 2D datasets? How does the method perform on real-world or more complex datasets?\n2. What is the motivation behind this method? What challenges in low-dimensional diffusion models does it aim to solve?\n3.

The insights gained from this work could inform the development of more efficient and effective noise scheduling techniques for diffusion models across various data types and dimensionalities.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\nThe experimental evaluation is limited to simple 2D datasets (circle, dino, line, and moons). While these datasets serve as a good starting point, the paper would benefit from demonstrating the method's effectiveness on higher-dimensional low-dimensional datasets (e.g., 3D, 4D) to strengthen the generalizability of the findings. The current evaluation does not explore the method's behavior with respect to increased dimensionality, which is a critical aspect for broader applicability.\n\nThe paper lacks a detailed discussion on the selection of grid sizes (5x5 and 20x20) and the regularization strength. Providing guidelines or an analysis of how these hyperparameters affect performance would enhance the reproducibility and practicality of the method. The absence of a systematic approach to hyperparameter tuning makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the proposed method. For instance, it is unclear if the chosen grid sizes are optimal for all low-dimensional datasets or if they need to be adapted based on the specific data characteristics.\n\nThe proposed method introduces additional computational overhead due to the multi-scale grid structure and the L1 regularization. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity or a comparison of training and inference times with baseline methods. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to evaluate the practical feasibility of the method, especially for resource-constrained environments. A thorough complexity analysis is needed to understand the trade-offs between performance gains and computational costs.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo enhance the paper, the authors should extend their experimental evaluation to include datasets with higher dimensionality, such as 3D or 4D data. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's scalability and generalizability. For example, the authors could consider using synthetic datasets with varying dimensions or real-world datasets from fields like computational fluid dynamics or financial modeling. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to analyze how the performance of the proposed method changes with increasing dimensionality, identifying any potential bottlenecks or limitations. This analysis should include a discussion of the computational costs associated with higher-dimensional data and how the method's performance compares to standard diffusion models in these settings. Such an analysis would significantly strengthen the paper's claims and broaden its applicability.\n\nIn addition, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the hyperparameter selection process, specifically regarding the grid sizes and regularization strength. This could involve conducting a sensitivity analysis to determine how the performance of the method is affected by different values of these hyperparameters. The authors could also explore adaptive strategies for selecting these parameters based on the characteristics of the input data. For example, they could investigate whether the optimal grid size is related to the complexity of the data distribution or the dimensionality of the data. Providing guidelines or heuristics for selecting these hyperparameters would greatly enhance the practicality and reproducibility of the method. This would allow other researchers to apply the method more effectively to their own datasets.\n\nFinally, the paper should include a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method. This analysis should compare the training and inference times of the proposed method with those of standard diffusion models. The authors should also discuss the memory requirements of the method, especially when dealing with higher-dimensional data. This analysis should provide insights into the trade-offs between performance gains and computational costs, allowing practitioners to make informed decisions about the applicability of the method in different settings. Furthermore, the authors could explore potential optimizations to reduce the computational overhead of the method, such as using more efficient grid structures or regularization techniques.\n\n### Questions\n\nThe paper introduces a 5x5 coarse grid and a 20x20 fine grid for noise adaptation.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism designed to enhance the performance of diffusion models when applied to low-dimensional datasets. The core idea revolves around the use of two learnable grids, a coarse 5x5 grid and a fine 20x20 grid, which dynamically adjust noise levels during the diffusion process. This approach aims to address the challenges posed by the limited spatial complexity of low-dimensional data, where standard diffusion models often struggle to capture the underlying data distribution accurately. The method incorporates L1 regularization on the fine grid to encourage sparsity, thereby focusing on the most relevant fine-grained adjustments. The authors evaluate their proposed method on four diverse 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons, demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching compared to a baseline DDPM model. Specifically, they report reductions in KL divergence of up to 41.6% and 36.8% on the line and moons datasets, respectively. The experimental results also show that the proposed method achieves lower evaluation loss compared to the baseline, indicating a better fit to the data. The paper provides a clear explanation of the proposed method, detailing the mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps involved. The authors also present ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of each component of their method, including the multi-scale grid structure and the L1 regularization. The research opens up new avenues for applying diffusion models in domains with low-dimensional data, such as scientific simulation, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis. The insights gained from this work could inform the development of more efficient and effective noise scheduling techniques for diffusion models across various data types and dimensionalities. However, the paper also acknowledges the increased training time associated with the proposed method, which is approximately 79% longer than the baseline DDPM. Despite this, the authors argue that the improvements in sample quality and distribution matching justify the additional computational cost. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions, including extending the approach to higher-dimensional data and applying it to specific domain problems. Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of diffusion models, offering a novel approach to address the unique challenges of low-dimensional data generation. The proposed multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism, combined with L1 regularization, represents a significant step forward in improving the performance of diffusion models in this context.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThis paper presents a compelling approach to enhancing diffusion models for low-dimensional data, and I find several aspects of the work to be particularly strong. The core strength lies in the introduction of the multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism. This novel approach, which combines a coarse 5x5 grid with a fine 20x20 grid, allows for dynamic adjustment of noise levels during the diffusion process. This is a creative solution to the challenges posed by low-dimensional data, where standard noise scheduling techniques often fall short. The use of L1 regularization on the fine grid is another notable strength, as it encourages sparsity and focuses the model on the most relevant fine-grained adjustments. This regularization technique is well-suited to the problem and contributes to the overall effectiveness of the method. The paper also provides a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method, making it easy to understand and follow. The mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps are presented in a logical and accessible manner. Furthermore, the experimental results are compelling, demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching compared to the baseline DDPM model. The reported reductions in KL divergence, particularly on the line and moons datasets, are substantial and provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method. The use of ablation studies is another strength of the paper. By systematically removing components of the method, the authors demonstrate the contribution of each element, including the multi-scale grid structure and the L1 regularization. This approach provides a clear understanding of how the method works and why it is effective. The paper also identifies a critical gap in the existing literature, which is the lack of effective methods for applying diffusion models to low-dimensional data. By addressing this gap, the authors have opened up new avenues for research and application in various domains, such as scientific simulation, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis. The insights gained from this work could inform the development of more efficient and effective noise scheduling techniques for diffusion models across various data types and dimensionalities. Finally, the paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to read and understand. The authors have clearly articulated their ideas and presented their findings in a logical and coherent manner. Overall, the strengths of this paper lie in its novel approach, clear explanation, compelling results, and identification of a critical gap in the existing literature.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. The most significant limitation is the narrow scope of the experimental evaluation. The authors conducted experiments on only four 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. While these datasets serve as a good starting point, they are relatively simple and do not fully represent the complexity of real-world low-dimensional data. The paper lacks any demonstration of the method's effectiveness on higher-dimensional low-dimensional datasets (e.g., 3D, 4D), which is a critical aspect for broader applicability. This limitation is explicitly stated in the experimental setup section, where the authors mention using four 2D datasets. The absence of experiments on more complex datasets raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. The paper also lacks a detailed discussion on the selection of grid sizes (5x5 and 20x20) and the regularization strength. The authors introduce these hyperparameters but do not provide any justification or analysis for their specific values. For instance, the paper states that a 5x5 coarse grid and a 20x20 fine grid are used, but there is no explanation of why these specific sizes were chosen. Similarly, the L1 regularization weight is set to 0.001, but there is no discussion of how this value was determined or whether it is optimal for all low-dimensional datasets. This lack of a systematic approach to hyperparameter tuning makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the proposed method. It is unclear if the chosen grid sizes are optimal for all low-dimensional datasets or if they need to be adapted based on the specific data characteristics. This is a significant weakness, as it limits the practical applicability of the method. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method. While the authors report training and inference times for different configurations, they do not include a formal analysis of how the multi-scale grid structure affects the computational cost. The paper mentions that the proposed models incur increased training times compared to the baseline DDPM, with the multi-scale grid approach with L1 regularization taking approximately 79% longer to train. However, there is no discussion of how the training and inference times scale with the addition of the multi-scale grid structure. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to evaluate the practical feasibility of the method, especially for resource-constrained environments. A thorough complexity analysis is needed to understand the trade-offs between performance gains and computational costs. The paper also lacks a comparison against other state-of-the-art generative models for low-dimensional data. While the authors compare their method to a baseline DDPM, they do not benchmark against other models that are known to perform well on similar types of data. This makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed method. Although the related work section mentions TabDDPM, there is no direct performance comparison. This is a significant omission, as it limits the ability to contextualize the performance of the proposed method within the broader landscape of generative modeling. Finally, the paper does not provide any preliminary results or case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world applications. The authors mention potential applications in scientific simulation, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis, but there is no evidence to support these claims. The lack of real-world validation limits the practical relevance of the paper. All of these weaknesses are supported by direct evidence from the paper, and they have a substantial impact on the conclusions and generalizability of the findings. I have high confidence in these identified limitations.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses and further strengthen this work, I recommend several concrete improvements. First and foremost, the authors should significantly expand their experimental evaluation to include datasets with higher dimensionality, such as 3D and 4D data. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's scalability and generalizability. For example, the authors could consider using synthetic datasets with varying dimensions or real-world datasets from fields like computational fluid dynamics or financial modeling. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to analyze how the performance of the proposed method changes with increasing dimensionality, identifying any potential bottlenecks or limitations. This analysis should include a discussion of the computational costs associated with higher-dimensional data and how the method's performance compares to standard diffusion models in these settings. Such an analysis would significantly strengthen the paper's claims and broaden its applicability. In addition, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the hyperparameter selection process, specifically regarding the grid sizes and regularization strength. This could involve conducting a sensitivity analysis to determine how the performance of the method is affected by different values of these hyperparameters. The authors could also explore adaptive strategies for selecting these parameters based on the characteristics of the input data. For example, they could investigate whether the optimal grid size is related to the complexity of the data distribution or the dimensionality of the data. Providing guidelines or heuristics for selecting these hyperparameters would greatly enhance the practicality and reproducibility of the method. This would allow other researchers to apply the method more effectively to their own datasets. Furthermore, the authors should include a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method. This analysis should compare the training and inference times of the proposed method with those of standard diffusion models. The authors should also discuss the memory requirements of the method, especially when dealing with higher-dimensional data. This analysis should provide insights into the trade-offs between performance gains and computational costs, allowing practitioners to make informed decisions about the applicability of the method in different settings. Furthermore, the authors could explore potential optimizations to reduce the computational overhead of the method, such as using more efficient grid structures or regularization techniques. The paper should also include a comparison against other state-of-the-art generative models for low-dimensional data. This would involve benchmarking against models that are known to perform well on similar types of data, even if they are not specifically designed for low-dimensional data. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the authors should provide preliminary results or case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world applications. This could involve applying the method to datasets from scientific simulation, financial modeling, or geospatial analysis. Such real-world validation would significantly enhance the practical relevance of the paper. By addressing these weaknesses, the authors can significantly improve the quality and impact of their work.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the proposed method. First, regarding the multi-scale grid structure, the paper introduces a 5x5 coarse grid and a 20x20 fine grid for noise adaptation. I am curious about the rationale behind these specific grid sizes. How were these sizes determined? Would different grid sizes significantly impact performance, and is there an optimal range for these parameters? It would be beneficial to understand the sensitivity of the method to these choices. Second, the paper mentions the use of L1 regularization for the fine grid, with a regularization strength (λ) set to 0.001. I am interested in understanding how sensitive the model's performance is to this regularization strength. Is there a systematic way to determine the optimal regularization parameter for different datasets? A sensitivity analysis or a discussion of the impact of different λ values would be valuable. Third, the paper reports increased training times for the proposed models compared to the baseline DDPM. I would like to see a more detailed complexity analysis. How do the training and inference times scale with the addition of the multi-scale grid structure? A formal analysis of the computational complexity would provide a clearer picture of the trade-offs involved. Fourth, the paper focuses on low-dimensional data, specifically 2D datasets in the experiments. I am curious about how well the proposed method would generalize to slightly higher-dimensional low-dimensional data (e.g., 3D, 4D). Are there any modifications needed to scale the approach beyond 2D? Understanding the limitations and potential adaptations for higher dimensions is crucial. Finally, the paper mentions potential applications in scientific simulation, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis. I am interested in knowing if there are any preliminary results or case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in any of these real-world applications. Such evidence would significantly strengthen the practical relevance of the work. These questions target key uncertainties and methodological choices, seeking clarification of critical assumptions and limitations. Addressing these questions would provide a more complete and robust understanding of the proposed method.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism designed to enhance the performance of diffusion models when applied to low-dimensional datasets. The core idea revolves around the use of two learnable grids, a coarse 5x5 grid and a fine 20x20 grid, which dynamically adjust noise levels during the diffusion process. This approach aims to address the challenges posed by the limited spatial complexity of low-dimensional data, where standard diffusion models often struggle to capture the underlying data distribution accurately. The method incorporates L1 regularization on the fine grid to encourage sparsity, thereby focusing on the most relevant fine-grained adjustments. The authors evaluate their proposed method on four diverse 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons, demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching compared to a baseline DDPM model. Specifically, they report reductions in KL divergence of up to 41.6% and 36.8% on the line and moons datasets, respectively. The experimental results also show that the proposed method achieves lower evaluation loss compared to the baseline, indicating a better fit to the data. The paper provides a clear explanation of the proposed method, detailing the mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps involved. The authors also present ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of each component of their method, including the multi-scale grid structure and the L1 regularization. The research opens up new avenues for applying diffusion models in domains with low-dimensional data, such as scientific simulation, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis. The insights gained from this work could inform the development of more efficient and effective noise scheduling techniques for diffusion models across various data types and dimensionalities. However, the paper also acknowledges the increased training time associated with the proposed method, which is approximately 79% longer than the baseline DDPM. Despite this, the authors argue that the improvements in sample quality and distribution matching justify the additional computational cost. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions, including extending the approach to higher-dimensional data and applying it to specific domain problems. Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of diffusion models, offering a novel approach to address the unique challenges of low-dimensional data generation. The proposed multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism, combined with L1 regularization, represents a significant step forward in improving the performance of diffusion models in this context.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThis paper presents a compelling approach to enhancing diffusion models for low-dimensional data, and I find several aspects of the work to be particularly strong. The core strength lies in the introduction of the multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism. This novel approach, which combines a coarse 5x5 grid with a fine 20x20 grid, allows for dynamic adjustment of noise levels during the diffusion process. This is a creative solution to the challenges posed by low-dimensional data, where standard noise scheduling techniques often fall short. The use of L1 regularization on the fine grid is another notable strength, as it encourages sparsity and focuses the model on the most relevant fine-grained adjustments. This regularization technique is well-suited to the problem and contributes to the overall effectiveness of the method. The paper also provides a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method, making it easy to understand and follow. The mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps are presented in a logical and accessible manner. Furthermore, the experimental results are compelling, demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching compared to the baseline DDPM model. The reported reductions in KL divergence, particularly on the line and moons datasets, are substantial and provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method. The use of ablation studies is another strength of the paper. By systematically removing components of the method, the authors demonstrate the contribution of each element, including the multi-scale grid structure and the L1 regularization. This approach provides a clear understanding of how the method works and why it is effective. The paper also identifies a critical gap in the existing literature, which is the lack of effective methods for applying diffusion models to low-dimensional data. By addressing this gap, the authors have opened up new avenues for research and application in various domains, such as scientific simulation, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis. The insights gained from this work could inform the development of more efficient and effective noise scheduling techniques for diffusion models across various data types and dimensionalities. Finally, the paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to read and understand. The authors have clearly articulated their ideas and presented their findings in a logical and coherent manner. Overall, the strengths of this paper lie in its novel approach, clear explanation, compelling results, and identification of a critical gap in the existing literature.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. The most significant limitation is the narrow scope of the experimental evaluation. The authors conducted experiments on only four 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. While these datasets serve as a good starting point, they are relatively simple and do not fully represent the complexity of real-world low-dimensional data. The paper lacks any demonstration of the method's effectiveness on higher-dimensional low-dimensional datasets (e.g., 3D, 4D), which is a critical aspect for broader applicability. This limitation is explicitly stated in the experimental setup section, where the authors mention using four 2D datasets. The absence of experiments on more complex datasets raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. The paper also lacks a detailed discussion on the selection of grid sizes (5x5 and 20x20) and the regularization strength. The authors introduce these hyperparameters but do not provide any justification or analysis for their specific values. For instance, the paper states that a 5x5 coarse grid and a 20x20 fine grid are used, but there is no explanation of why these specific sizes were chosen. Similarly, the L1 regularization weight is set to 0.001, but there is no discussion of how this value was determined or whether it is optimal for all low-dimensional datasets. This lack of a systematic approach to hyperparameter tuning makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the proposed method. It is unclear if the chosen grid sizes are optimal for all low-dimensional datasets or if they need to be adapted based on the specific data characteristics. This is a significant weakness, as it limits the practical applicability of the method. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method. While the authors report training and inference times for different configurations, they do not include a formal analysis of how the multi-scale grid structure affects the computational cost. The paper mentions that the proposed models incur increased training times compared to the baseline DDPM, with the multi-scale grid approach with L1 regularization taking approximately 79% longer to train. However, there is no discussion of how the training and inference times scale with the addition of the multi-scale grid structure. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to evaluate the practical feasibility of the method, especially for resource-constrained environments. A thorough complexity analysis is needed to understand the trade-offs between performance gains and computational costs. The paper also lacks a comparison against other state-of-the-art generative models for low-dimensional data. While the authors compare their method to a baseline DDPM, they do not benchmark against other models that are known to perform well on similar types of data. This makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed method. Although the related work section mentions TabDDPM, there is no direct performance comparison. This is a significant omission, as it limits the ability to contextualize the performance of the proposed method within the broader landscape of generative modeling. Finally, the paper does not provide any preliminary results or case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world applications. The authors mention potential applications in scientific simulation, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis, but there is no evidence to support these claims. The lack of real-world validation limits the practical relevance of the paper. All of these weaknesses are supported by direct evidence from the paper, and they have a substantial impact on the conclusions and generalizability of the findings. I have high confidence in these identified limitations.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses and further strengthen this work, I recommend several concrete improvements. First and foremost, the authors should significantly expand their experimental evaluation to include datasets with higher dimensionality, such as 3D and 4D data. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's scalability and generalizability. For example, the authors could consider using synthetic datasets with varying dimensions or real-world datasets from fields like computational fluid dynamics or financial modeling. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to analyze how the performance of the proposed method changes with increasing dimensionality, identifying any potential bottlenecks or limitations. This analysis should include a discussion of the computational costs associated with higher-dimensional data and how the method's performance compares to standard diffusion models in these settings. Such an analysis would significantly strengthen the paper's claims and broaden its applicability. In addition, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the hyperparameter selection process, specifically regarding the grid sizes and regularization strength. This could involve conducting a sensitivity analysis to determine how the performance of the method is affected by different values of these hyperparameters. The authors could also explore adaptive strategies for selecting these parameters based on the characteristics of the input data. For example, they could investigate whether the optimal grid size is related to the complexity of the data distribution or the dimensionality of the data. Providing guidelines or heuristics for selecting these hyperparameters would greatly enhance the practicality and reproducibility of the method. This would allow other researchers to apply the method more effectively to their own datasets. Furthermore, the authors should include a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method. This analysis should compare the training and inference times of the proposed method with those of standard diffusion models. The authors should also discuss the memory requirements of the method, especially when dealing with higher-dimensional data. This analysis should provide insights into the trade-offs between performance gains and computational costs, allowing practitioners to make informed decisions about the applicability of the method in different settings. Furthermore, the authors could explore potential optimizations to reduce the computational overhead of the method, such as using more efficient grid structures or regularization techniques. The paper should also include a comparison against other state-of-the-art generative models for low-dimensional data. This would involve benchmarking against models that are known to perform well on similar types of data, even if they are not specifically designed for low-dimensional data. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the authors should provide preliminary results or case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world applications. This could involve applying the method to datasets from scientific simulation, financial modeling, or geospatial analysis. Such real-world validation would significantly enhance the practical relevance of the paper. By addressing these weaknesses, the authors can significantly improve the quality and impact of their work.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the proposed method. First, regarding the multi-scale grid structure, the paper introduces a 5x5 coarse grid and a 20x20 fine grid for noise adaptation. I am curious about the rationale behind these specific grid sizes. How were these sizes determined? Would different grid sizes significantly impact performance, and is there an optimal range for these parameters? It would be beneficial to understand the sensitivity of the method to these choices. Second, the paper mentions the use of L1 regularization for the fine grid, with a regularization strength (λ) set to 0.001. I am interested in understanding how sensitive the model's performance is to this regularization strength. Is there a systematic way to determine the optimal regularization parameter for different datasets? A sensitivity analysis or a discussion of the impact of different λ values would be valuable. Third, the paper reports increased training times for the proposed models compared to the baseline DDPM. I would like to see a more detailed complexity analysis. How do the training and inference times scale with the addition of the multi-scale grid structure? A formal analysis of the computational complexity would provide a clearer picture of the trade-offs involved. Fourth, the paper focuses on low-dimensional data, specifically 2D datasets in the experiments. I am curious about how well the proposed method would generalize to slightly higher-dimensional low-dimensional data (e.g., 3D, 4D). Are there any modifications needed to scale the approach beyond 2D? Understanding the limitations and potential adaptations for higher dimensions is crucial. Finally, the paper mentions potential applications in scientific simulation, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis. I am interested in knowing if there are any preliminary results or case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in any of these real-world applications. Such evidence would significantly strengthen the practical relevance of the work. These questions target key uncertainties and methodological choices, seeking clarification of critical assumptions and limitations. Addressing these questions would provide a more complete and robust understanding of the proposed method.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",
                "summary": "This paper introduces a novel multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism designed to enhance the performance of diffusion models when applied to low-dimensional datasets. The core idea revolves around the use of two learnable grids, a coarse 5x5 grid and a fine 20x20 grid, which dynamically adjust noise levels during the diffusion process. This approach aims to address the challenges posed by the limited spatial complexity of low-dimensional data, where standard diffusion models often struggle to capture the underlying data distribution accurately. The method incorporates L1 regularization on the fine grid to encourage sparsity, thereby focusing on the most relevant fine-grained adjustments. The authors evaluate their proposed method on four diverse 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons, demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching compared to a baseline DDPM model. Specifically, they report reductions in KL divergence of up to 41.6% and 36.8% on the line and moons datasets, respectively. The experimental results also show that the proposed method achieves lower evaluation loss compared to the baseline, indicating a better fit to the data. The paper provides a clear explanation of the proposed method, detailing the mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps involved. The authors also present ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of each component of their method, including the multi-scale grid structure and the L1 regularization. The research opens up new avenues for applying diffusion models in domains with low-dimensional data, such as scientific simulation, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis. The insights gained from this work could inform the development of more efficient and effective noise scheduling techniques for diffusion models across various data types and dimensionalities. However, the paper also acknowledges the increased training time associated with the proposed method, which is approximately 79% longer than the baseline DDPM. Despite this, the authors argue that the improvements in sample quality and distribution matching justify the additional computational cost. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions, including extending the approach to higher-dimensional data and applying it to specific domain problems. Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of diffusion models, offering a novel approach to address the unique challenges of low-dimensional data generation. The proposed multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism, combined with L1 regularization, represents a significant step forward in improving the performance of diffusion models in this context.",

The core strength lies in the introduction of the multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism. This novel approach, which combines a coarse 5x5 grid with a fine 20x20 grid, allows for dynamic adjustment of noise levels during the diffusion process. This is a creative solution to the challenges posed by low-dimensional data, where standard noise scheduling techniques often fall short. The use of L1 regularization on the fine grid is another notable strength, as it encourages sparsity and focuses the model on the most relevant fine-grained adjustments. This regularization technique is well-suited to the problem and contributes to the overall effectiveness of the method. The paper also provides a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method, making it easy to understand and follow. The mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps are presented in a logical and accessible manner. Furthermore, the experimental results are compelling, demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching compared to the baseline DDPM model. The reported reductions in KL divergence, particularly on the line and moons datasets, are substantial and provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method. The use of ablation studies is another strength of the paper. By systematically removing components of the method, the authors demonstrate the contribution of each element, including the multi-scale grid structure and the L1 regularization. This approach provides a clear understanding of how the method works and why it is effective. The paper also identifies a critical gap in the existing literature, which is the lack of effective methods for applying diffusion models to low-dimensional data. By addressing this gap, the authors have opened up new avenues for research and application in various domains, such as scientific simulation, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis. The insights gained from this work could inform the development of more efficient and effective noise scheduling techniques for diffusion models across various data types and dimensionalities. Finally, the paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to read and understand. The authors have clearly articulated their ideas and presented their findings in a logical and coherent manner. Overall, the strengths of this paper lie in its novel approach, clear explanation, compelling results, and identification of a critical gap in the existing literature.",
                "weaknesses": "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. The most significant limitation is the narrow scope of the experimental evaluation. The authors conducted experiments on only four 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. While these datasets serve as a good starting point, they are relatively simple and do not fully represent the complexity of real-world low-dimensional data. The paper lacks any demonstration of the method's effectiveness on higher-dimensional low-dimensional datasets (e.g., 3D, 4D), which is a critical aspect for broader applicability. This limitation is explicitly stated in the experimental setup section, where the authors mention using four 2D datasets. The absence of experiments on more complex datasets raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. The paper also lacks a detailed discussion on the selection of grid sizes (5x5 and 20x20) and the regularization strength. The authors introduce these hyperparameters but do not provide any justification or analysis for their specific values. For instance, the paper states that a 5x5 coarse grid and a 20x20 fine grid are used, but there is no explanation of why these specific sizes were chosen. Similarly, the L1 regularization weight is set to 0.001, but there is no discussion of how this value was determined or whether it is optimal for all low-dimensional datasets. This lack of a systematic approach to hyperparameter tuning makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the proposed method. It is unclear if the chosen grid sizes are optimal for all low-dimensional datasets or if they need to be adapted based on the specific data characteristics. This is a significant weakness, as it limits the practical applicability of the method. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method. While the authors report training and inference times for different configurations, they do not include a formal analysis of how the multi-scale grid structure affects the computational cost. The paper mentions that the proposed models incur increased training times compared to the baseline DDPM, with the multi-scale grid approach with L1 regularization taking approximately 79% longer to train. However, there is no discussion of how the training and inference times scale with the addition of the multi-scale grid structure. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to evaluate the practical feasibility of the method, especially for resource-constrained environments. A thorough complexity analysis is needed to understand the trade-offs between performance gains and computational costs. The paper also lacks a comparison against other state-of-the-art generative models for low-dimensional data.

The experimental setup is too simple to make any significant contribution. The model is only trained for 7500 steps, and all the experiments are conducted on a model with only 2 layers. Although this paper is not the first one to study the grokking phenomenon, the findings of this paper cannot lead to a better understanding of grokking either. The tasks used are also very basic, lacking the complexity to provide meaningful insights into the grokking phenomenon.\n2. The findings are preliminary and not conclusive. The paper does not explore the sensitivity of the results to different learning rate schedules or provide a detailed analysis of why the proposed method works. The lack of ablation studies makes it difficult to assess the importance of each component of the proposed approach.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe authors should significantly expand the scope of their experiments to include more complex tasks and deeper models. Specifically, they should consider using tasks that require more sophisticated reasoning and generalization capabilities, such as those involving recursive structures or logical inference. Additionally, the model architecture should be varied to include models with more layers, and the training duration should be extended to ensure that the grokking phenomenon has a chance to manifest. It would also be beneficial to explore different model architectures beyond the basic transformer, such as models with varying attention mechanisms or different types of feed-forward networks. This would help to determine if the observed effects are specific to the chosen architecture or more general.\n\nTo address the preliminary nature of the findings, the authors should conduct a more thorough analysis of the proposed method. This should include a sensitivity analysis of the learning rates for each layer, as well as an investigation into the impact of different learning rate schedules. Furthermore, the authors should perform ablation studies to determine the contribution of each component of their approach. For example, they could compare the performance of the model when only the embedding layer learning rate is changed, when only the lower transformer layer learning rate is changed, and when only the higher transformer layer learning rate is changed. This would help to identify which layers are most sensitive to changes in learning rate and provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the training dynamics, such as the evolution of the loss and accuracy over time, to better understand how the proposed method affects the learning process.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide a more in-depth discussion of the theoretical implications of their findings. While a full theoretical analysis may be beyond the scope of this work, they should at least provide some insights into why the proposed method works and how it relates to existing theories of grokking. This could involve discussing the role of different layers in the model and how they contribute to the generalization process. The authors should also consider exploring the connection between the proposed method and other techniques for improving generalization, such as regularization or data augmentation.

The authors provide empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of their method across various algorithmic tasks, showing significant improvements in convergence speed and final performance.\n\n4. The ablation study provides valuable insights into the importance of differentiating learning rates across all three components of the Transformer model.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The experiments are conducted on relatively small Transformer models and algorithmic tasks. It is unclear how well the proposed method would scale to larger models and more complex tasks. The authors should provide more discussion on the potential limitations and challenges of applying their approach to larger models and more complex tasks. Specifically, the paper lacks an analysis of how the proposed layer-wise learning rates interact with the increased number of parameters and the more intricate optimization landscapes of larger models. The current experiments do not sufficiently demonstrate the robustness of the method to these scaling challenges.\n\n2. The paper lacks a theoretical analysis of why layer-wise learning rates facilitate grokking. While the empirical results are promising, a theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms would strengthen the paper's contribution. The authors should discuss potential directions for future research in this area. For example, the paper does not explore the connection between the proposed learning rate schedule and the spectral properties of the weight matrices, or how it might affect the information flow within the network during the grokking phase. A theoretical framework would help to generalize the findings beyond the specific tasks considered.\n\n3. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other optimization techniques that could potentially accelerate grokking, such as adaptive learning rate methods or curriculum learning strategies.

This should include an analysis of how the method performs with varying model sizes and task complexities, and a discussion of any limitations or challenges encountered. Specifically, the authors should investigate the impact of the proposed learning rate schedule on the training dynamics of larger models, such as the convergence speed and the stability of the training process. They should also explore the potential need for adjustments to the learning rate schedule as the model size increases. Furthermore, the authors should consider using more diverse datasets and tasks to evaluate the generalizability of their approach. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nTo strengthen the theoretical foundation of the paper, the authors should investigate the underlying mechanisms that explain why layer-wise learning rates facilitate grokking. This could involve analyzing the gradient flow and the information propagation within the network under the proposed learning rate schedule. The authors should explore the connection between the learning rate schedule and the spectral properties of the weight matrices, and how this might affect the model's ability to generalize. They could also investigate the relationship between the learning rate schedule and the emergence of specific features or representations in different layers. This theoretical analysis should aim to provide a deeper understanding of the grokking phenomenon and the role of layer-wise learning rates in facilitating it.

This should include a comparison with adaptive learning rate methods, curriculum learning strategies, and other methods that explicitly target the grokking phenomenon. The comparison should focus on the convergence speed, final performance, and the computational cost of each method. The authors should also discuss the unique advantages and limitations of their proposed layer-wise learning rate strategy compared to these other methods. This would help to contextualize the contribution of their work and highlight its specific benefits in the context of grokking. The authors should also consider exploring the potential for combining their method with other optimization techniques to further improve performance.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a layer-wise learning rate strategy for Transformer models, aiming to enhance the grokking phenomenon on algorithmic tasks. The core idea is to assign different learning rates to the embedding, lower, and higher layers of the Transformer, motivated by the observation that different layers learn at varying rates and capture different levels of abstraction. The authors empirically demonstrate that this approach can significantly reduce the time to achieve 99% validation accuracy while maintaining or improving final model accuracy on tasks such as modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutations. The method is straightforward to implement and shows promising results in the specific context of grokking on small-scale algorithmic tasks. However, the paper's experimental setup is limited to a 2-layer Transformer model and a training duration of 7500 steps, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings to more complex models and tasks. Additionally, the paper lacks a detailed theoretical analysis of why the proposed method is effective for grokking, and it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other optimization techniques that could potentially accelerate grokking. Despite these limitations, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of grokking in Transformer models and opens avenues for further research.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience. The proposed layer-wise learning rate strategy is simple yet effective, and it is straightforward to implement using existing deep learning frameworks. The authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, drawing on the observation that different layers in deep neural networks often learn at different rates and capture varying levels of abstraction. This is a well-supported idea in the literature, and the paper effectively leverages it to address the grokking phenomenon. The empirical results are compelling, showing significant improvements in both convergence speed and final performance on a range of algorithmic tasks, including modular arithmetic and permutations. The ablation study, which explores the impact of different learning rate configurations, provides valuable insights into the importance of differentiating learning rates across all three components of the Transformer model. The authors also demonstrate that their method can reduce the time to achieve 99% validation accuracy by up to 60%, which is a substantial improvement in the context of grokking. Overall, the paper makes a novel contribution to the field by being the first to leverage layer-wise learning rates to enhance grokking in Transformer models, and it provides a solid foundation for further research in this area.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile the paper presents a promising approach to enhancing grokking in Transformer models, several limitations and concerns need to be addressed to strengthen its contributions. First, the experimental setup is overly simplistic, which limits the generalizability of the findings. The authors conduct experiments on a Transformer model with only two layers and a limited set of algorithmic tasks, such as modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutations of 5 elements. These tasks and the model architecture are relatively basic, and it is unclear how well the proposed method would scale to more complex models and tasks. The lack of experiments on larger models and more diverse datasets makes it difficult to assess the practical impact of the proposed method. For instance, the paper does not explore the performance of the method on tasks that require more sophisticated reasoning or involve larger datasets, which are crucial for understanding the robustness of the approach. The authors should consider expanding their experimental setup to include deeper models and more challenging tasks to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their method's effectiveness and scalability.\n\nSecond, the paper lacks a detailed theoretical analysis of why layer-wise learning rates are particularly effective for inducing grokking. While the empirical results are promising, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms would significantly enhance the paper's contribution. The authors mention that different layers learn at different rates and capture varying levels of abstraction, but they do not provide a mechanistic explanation of how the proposed learning rate schedule facilitates the emergence of generalization. For example, the paper does not explore the gradient norms or the feature representations of different layers to understand how they evolve over time with the proposed method. A theoretical framework that connects the learning rate schedule to the spectral properties of the weight matrices or the information flow within the network would help to generalize the findings beyond the specific tasks considered. This is a critical gap, as the grokking phenomenon is still not well understood, and a theoretical analysis could provide valuable insights into its nature.\n\nThird, the paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other optimization techniques that could potentially accelerate grokking. The authors primarily compare their method against a uniform learning rate strategy, which is a reasonable baseline but does not fully contextualize the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Other optimization techniques, such as adaptive learning rate methods (e.g., cosine annealing with warmup) or curriculum learning strategies, could also be effective in accelerating grokking. The absence of these comparisons makes it difficult to evaluate the true advantages and limitations of the layer-wise learning rate strategy. The authors should include a more detailed comparison with these techniques, focusing on convergence speed, final performance, and computational cost, to provide a more robust evaluation of their method.\n\nFourth, the paper does not explore the sensitivity of the proposed method to the choice of learning rates for each layer. While the authors mention that they conducted multiple runs with different learning rate configurations, they do not present a systematic sensitivity analysis. This is important because the optimal learning rates for each layer may vary depending on the specific task and model architecture. A sensitivity analysis would provide valuable insights into the robustness of the method and help practitioners to apply it effectively. The authors should investigate how the performance varies with different learning rate schedules and magnitudes for each layer, and provide guidelines for selecting appropriate values. This analysis should also consider the interaction between the learning rates of different layers, as this could have a significant impact on the training dynamics and the emergence of grokking.\n\nFinally, the paper does not provide a detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and potential directions for future research. While the authors acknowledge the simplicity of the experimental setup, they do not fully explore the implications of this limitation. For example, they do not discuss the potential challenges of applying their method to larger models or more complex tasks, such as the increased number of parameters and the more intricate optimization landscapes. A more thorough discussion of these limitations would help to contextualize the findings and guide future research in this area. The authors should also consider exploring the sensitivity of their method to different hyperparameter settings, the impact of different layer-wise learning rate schedules, and the applicability of their method to other model architectures. By addressing these limitations and providing a more detailed analysis, the authors can significantly enhance the impact and credibility of their work.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the limitations identified in the paper, I recommend several concrete and actionable improvements. First, the authors should significantly expand the scope of their experiments to include more complex tasks and deeper models. Specifically, they should consider using tasks that require more sophisticated reasoning and generalization capabilities, such as those involving recursive structures or logical inference. This would help to demonstrate the generalizability of their findings and establish the practical relevance of their method. Additionally, the authors should vary the model architecture to include models with more layers, and they should extend the training duration to ensure that the grokking phenomenon has a chance to manifest. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSecond, the authors should conduct a more thorough analysis of the proposed method. This should include a sensitivity analysis of the learning rates for each layer, as well as an investigation into the impact of different learning rate schedules. For example, the authors could compare the performance of the model when only the embedding layer learning rate is changed, when only the lower transformer layer learning rate is changed, and when only the higher transformer layer learning rate is changed. This would help to identify which layers are most sensitive to changes in learning rate and provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the training dynamics, such as the evolution of the loss and accuracy over time, to better understand how the proposed method affects the learning process.\n\nThird, the authors should include a more comprehensive comparison with other optimization techniques. This should include not only computationally expensive methods but also simpler and widely used techniques such as cosine annealing with warmup. A detailed analysis of the computational cost of their method compared to these baselines is essential to justify the effectiveness of their approach. The authors should also consider comparing their method with other layer-wise optimization techniques, such as those that adapt learning rates based on layer depth or gradient statistics. This would help to clarify the unique advantages of their method and demonstrate its superiority over existing approaches. The comparison should include not only the final accuracy but also the convergence speed and the computational cost.\n\nFourth, the authors should provide a more in-depth discussion of the theoretical implications of their findings. While a full theoretical analysis may be beyond the scope of this work, they should at least provide some insights into why the proposed method works and how it relates to existing theories of grokking. This could involve discussing the role of different layers in the model and how they contribute to the generalization process. The authors should also consider exploring the connection between the proposed method and other techniques for improving generalization, such as regularization or data augmentation. This would help to place their findings in a broader context and make a more significant contribution to the field.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion of the limitations of their method and potential directions for future research. This could include exploring the sensitivity of their method to different hyperparameter settings, investigating the impact of different layer-wise learning rate schedules, and examining the applicability of their method to other model architectures. By addressing these limitations and providing a more thorough analysis of their method, the authors can significantly enhance the impact and credibility of their work.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\n1.

Specifically, they should consider using tasks that require more sophisticated reasoning and generalization capabilities, such as those involving recursive structures or logical inference. Additionally, the model architecture should be varied to include models with more layers, and the training duration should be extended to ensure that the grokking phenomenon has a chance to manifest.

This should include a sensitivity analysis of the learning rates for each layer, as well as an investigation into the impact of different learning rate schedules. Furthermore, the authors should perform ablation studies to determine the contribution of each component of their approach. For example, they could compare the performance of the model when only the embedding layer learning rate is changed, when only the lower transformer layer learning rate is changed, and when only the higher transformer layer learning rate is changed. This would help to identify which layers are most sensitive to changes in learning rate and provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the training dynamics, such as the evolution of the loss and accuracy over time, to better understand how the proposed method affects the learning process.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide a more in-depth discussion of the theoretical implications of their findings. While a full theoretical analysis may be beyond the scope of this work, they should at least provide some insights into why the proposed method works and how it relates to existing theories of grokking. This could involve discussing the role of different layers in the model and how they contribute to the generalization process. The authors should also consider exploring the connection between the proposed method and other techniques for improving generalization, such as regularization or data augmentation. This would help to place their findings in a broader context and make a more significant contribution to the field.\n\n### Questions\n\nN/A\n\n### Rating\n\n1\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********"

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a layer-wise learning rate strategy for Transformer models, aiming to enhance the grokking phenomenon on algorithmic tasks. The core idea is to assign different learning rates to the embedding, lower, and higher layers of the Transformer, motivated by the observation that different layers learn at varying rates and capture different levels of abstraction. The authors empirically demonstrate that this approach can significantly reduce the time to achieve 99% validation accuracy while maintaining or improving final model accuracy on tasks such as modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutations. The method is straightforward to implement and shows promising results in the specific context of grokking on small-scale algorithmic tasks. However, the paper's experimental setup is limited to a 2-layer Transformer model and a training duration of 7500 steps, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings to more complex models and tasks. Additionally, the paper lacks a detailed theoretical analysis of why the proposed method is effective for grokking, and it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other optimization techniques that could potentially accelerate grokking. Despite these limitations, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of grokking in Transformer models and opens avenues for further research.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience. The proposed layer-wise learning rate strategy is simple yet effective, and it is straightforward to implement using existing deep learning frameworks. The authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, drawing on the observation that different layers in deep neural networks often learn at different rates and capture varying levels of abstraction. This is a well-supported idea in the literature, and the paper effectively leverages it to address the grokking phenomenon. The empirical results are compelling, showing significant improvements in both convergence speed and final performance on a range of algorithmic tasks, including modular arithmetic and permutations. The ablation study, which explores the impact of different learning rate configurations, provides valuable insights into the importance of differentiating learning rates across all three components of the Transformer model. The authors also demonstrate that their method can reduce the time to achieve 99% validation accuracy by up to 60%, which is a substantial improvement in the context of grokking. Overall, the paper makes a novel contribution to the field by being the first to leverage layer-wise learning rates to enhance grokking in Transformer models, and it provides a solid foundation for further research in this area.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile the paper presents a promising approach to enhancing grokking in Transformer models, several limitations and concerns need to be addressed to strengthen its contributions. First, the experimental setup is overly simplistic, which limits the generalizability of the findings. The authors conduct experiments on a Transformer model with only two layers and a limited set of algorithmic tasks, such as modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutations of 5 elements. These tasks and the model architecture are relatively basic, and it is unclear how well the proposed method would scale to more complex models and tasks. The lack of experiments on larger models and more diverse datasets makes it difficult to assess the practical impact of the proposed method. For instance, the paper does not explore the performance of the method on tasks that require more sophisticated reasoning or involve larger datasets, which are crucial for understanding the robustness of the approach. The authors should consider expanding their experimental setup to include deeper models and more challenging tasks to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their method's effectiveness and scalability.\n\nSecond, the paper lacks a detailed theoretical analysis of why layer-wise learning rates are particularly effective for inducing grokking. While the empirical results are promising, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms would significantly enhance the paper's contribution. The authors mention that different layers learn at different rates and capture varying levels of abstraction, but they do not provide a mechanistic explanation of how the proposed learning rate schedule facilitates the emergence of generalization. For example, the paper does not explore the gradient norms or the feature representations of different layers to understand how they evolve over time with the proposed method. A theoretical framework that connects the learning rate schedule to the spectral properties of the weight matrices or the information flow within the network would help to generalize the findings beyond the specific tasks considered. This is a critical gap, as the grokking phenomenon is still not well understood, and a theoretical analysis could provide valuable insights into its nature.\n\nThird, the paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other optimization techniques that could potentially accelerate grokking. The authors primarily compare their method against a uniform learning rate strategy, which is a reasonable baseline but does not fully contextualize the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Other optimization techniques, such as adaptive learning rate methods (e.g., cosine annealing with warmup) or curriculum learning strategies, could also be effective in accelerating grokking. The absence of these comparisons makes it difficult to evaluate the true advantages and limitations of the layer-wise learning rate strategy. The authors should include a more detailed comparison with these techniques, focusing on convergence speed, final performance, and computational cost, to provide a more robust evaluation of their method.\n\nFourth, the paper does not explore the sensitivity of the proposed method to the choice of learning rates for each layer. While the authors mention that they conducted multiple runs with different learning rate configurations, they do not present a systematic sensitivity analysis. This is important because the optimal learning rates for each layer may vary depending on the specific task and model architecture. A sensitivity analysis would provide valuable insights into the robustness of the method and help practitioners to apply it effectively. The authors should investigate how the performance varies with different learning rate schedules and magnitudes for each layer, and provide guidelines for selecting appropriate values. This analysis should also consider the interaction between the learning rates of different layers, as this could have a significant impact on the training dynamics and the emergence of grokking.\n\nFinally, the paper does not provide a detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and potential directions for future research.

For example, they do not discuss the potential challenges of applying their method to larger models or more complex tasks, such as the increased number of parameters and the more intricate optimization landscapes. A more thorough discussion of these limitations would help to contextualize the findings and guide future research in this area.

By addressing these limitations and providing a more detailed analysis, the authors can significantly enhance the impact and credibility of their work.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the limitations identified in the paper, I recommend several concrete and actionable improvements. First, the authors should significantly expand the scope of their experiments to include more complex tasks and deeper models. Specifically, they should consider using tasks that require more sophisticated reasoning and generalization capabilities, such as those involving recursive structures or logical inference. This would help to demonstrate the generalizability of their findings and establish the practical relevance of their method. Additionally, the authors should vary the model architecture to include models with more layers, and they should extend the training duration to ensure that the grokking phenomenon has a chance to manifest.

A sensitivity analysis would provide valuable insights into the robustness of the method and help practitioners to apply it effectively. The authors should investigate how the performance varies with different learning rate schedules and magnitudes for each layer, and provide guidelines for selecting appropriate values. This analysis should also consider the interaction between the learning rates of different layers, as this could have a significant impact on the training dynamics and the emergence of grokking.\n\nFinally, the paper does not provide a detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and potential directions for future research. While the authors acknowledge the simplicity of the experimental setup, they do not fully explore the implications of this limitation. For example, they do not discuss the potential challenges of applying their method to larger models or more complex tasks, such as the increased number of parameters and the more intricate optimization landscapes. A more thorough discussion of these limitations would help to contextualize the findings and guide future research in this area. The authors should also consider exploring the sensitivity of their method to different hyperparameter settings, the impact of different layer-wise learning rate schedules, and the applicability of their method to other model architectures. By addressing these limitations and providing a more detailed analysis, the authors can significantly enhance the impact and credibility of their work.",
                "suggestions": "To address the limitations identified in the paper, I recommend several concrete and actionable improvements. First, the authors should significantly expand the scope of their experiments to include more complex tasks and deeper models. Specifically, they should consider using tasks that require more sophisticated reasoning and generalization capabilities, such as those involving recursive structures or logical inference. This would help to demonstrate the generalizability of their findings and establish the practical relevance of their method. Additionally, the authors should vary the model architecture to include models with more layers, and they should extend the training duration to ensure that the grokking phenomenon has a chance to manifest. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSecond, the authors should conduct a more thorough analysis of the proposed method. This should include a sensitivity analysis of the learning rates for each layer, as well as an investigation into the impact of different learning rate schedules. For example, the authors could compare the performance of the model when only the embedding layer learning rate is changed, when only the lower transformer layer learning rate is changed, and when only the higher transformer layer learning rate is changed. This would help to identify which layers are most sensitive to changes in learning rate and provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the training dynamics, such as the evolution of the loss and accuracy over time, to better understand how the proposed method affects the learning process.\n\nThird, the authors should include a more comprehensive comparison with other optimization techniques. This should include not only computationally expensive methods but also simpler and widely used techniques such as cosine annealing with warmup. A detailed analysis of the computational cost of their method compared to these baselines is essential to justify the effectiveness of their approach. The authors should also consider comparing their method with other layer-wise optimization techniques, such as those that adapt learning rates based on layer depth or gradient statistics. This would help to clarify the unique advantages of their method and demonstrate its superiority over existing approaches. The comparison should include not only the final accuracy but also the convergence speed and the computational cost.\n\nFourth, the authors should provide a more in-depth discussion of the theoretical implications of their findings. While a full theoretical analysis may be beyond the scope of this work, they should at least provide some insights into why the proposed method works and how it relates to existing theories of grokking. This could involve discussing the role of different layers in the model and how they contribute to the generalization process. The authors should also consider exploring the connection between the proposed method and other techniques for improving generalization, such as regularization or data augmentation. This would help to place their findings in a broader context and make a more significant contribution to the field.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion of the limitations of their method and potential directions for future research. This could include exploring the sensitivity of their method to different hyperparameter settings, investigating the impact of different layer-wise learning rate schedules, and examining the applicability of their method to other model architectures. By addressing these limitations and providing a more thorough analysis of their method, the authors can significantly enhance the impact and credibility of their work.",

The current experiments are limited to a 2-layer model and simple algorithmic tasks, which may not fully capture the method's potential in more realistic settings.\n\n2.

Low-quality presentation:\n   - The author has not attempted to address the phenomenon of grokking, as the paper does not clearly explain what grokking is, its significance, or the current state of research. Additionally, the motivation for using MDL to study grokking is unclear.\n   - The paper lacks logical coherence, with the relationship between different sections unclear. It appears to be a collection of experimental results rather than a well-structured study.\n   - There is a noticeable lack of detail in the paper. For example, the method section is almost entirely missing, making it unclear how the study was conducted.\n2. Poor reproducibility: The paper does not provide any code, and critical details such as the model architecture and hyperparameters are not fully specified, making it difficult to reproduce the results.\n3. Limited contribution: The paper does not offer a thorough discussion of grokking or a detailed introduction to the proposed method, making it challenging to understand the value of the contribution.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper needs a significant restructuring to clearly articulate the problem of grokking, its importance in the field of neural networks, and the specific research gap this paper aims to address. The introduction should provide a comprehensive overview of grokking, including its key characteristics, the current understanding of its mechanisms, and the limitations of existing approaches. The authors should clearly explain why the Minimal Description Length (MDL) principle is a suitable framework for studying grokking, and what new insights can be gained by applying MDL. The motivation for using MDL should be explicitly stated, and the connection between MDL and the phenomenon of grokking should be thoroughly explained. Furthermore, the paper should clearly state the research question and the hypothesis being tested. Without this, the reader is left without a clear understanding of the paper's purpose and direction.\n\nThe methodology section requires a complete overhaul. The authors must provide a detailed description of the proposed method, including all the necessary mathematical formulations, algorithmic steps, and implementation details. The explanation of how MDL is estimated during training is crucial and should be explained with sufficient detail. The paper should also specify the model architecture used in the experiments, including the number of layers, the type of activation functions, and the number of parameters. The hyperparameter settings, such as the learning rate, batch size, and optimization algorithm, must also be clearly stated. Without these details, the reproducibility of the results is impossible. The authors should also explain the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model and the rationale behind their choice. The experimental setup should be described in detail, including the datasets used, the training procedure, and the validation procedure. The paper should also include a discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and the potential directions for future research.\n\nFinally, the paper needs a more thorough discussion of the results. The authors should not only present the experimental results but also provide a detailed analysis and interpretation of these results. The paper should discuss the implications of the findings for the understanding of grokking and the potential applications of the proposed method. The paper should also compare the results with existing approaches and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method. The conclusion should summarize the main findings of the paper and provide a clear statement of the contribution. The paper should also include a discussion of the limitations of the study and the potential directions for future research. The overall presentation of the paper needs to be improved to make it more accessible and understandable to the reader. The paper should be well-organized, with a clear logical flow, and the language should be precise and concise.\n\n### Questions\n\nN/A\n\n### Rating\n\n1\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper investigates the phenomenon of grokking in neural networks through the lens of Minimal Description Length (MDL), offering an information-theoretic perspective on sudden generalization. The authors propose a novel method to estimate and track MDL during training using weight pruning techniques, allowing them to analyze the relationship between model compression and generalization.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n2\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper introduces a novel method for estimating and tracking MDL during neural network training using weight pruning techniques. The authors provide empirical evidence for the relationship between MDL reduction and grokking, offering an information-theoretic perspective on sudden generalization. The paper analyzes the varying dynamics of MDL and grokking across different tasks, revealing task-specific challenges and patterns in the learning process. New visualization techniques and analysis methods are introduced to better understand the relationship between MDL transition points and grokking points.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\nThe choice of permutation tasks seems a bit unusual, as it is difficult to imagine this task being solved by a neural network in real-world applications. Additionally, the paper does not provide sufficient explanation or justification for the selection of these tasks. The method for estimating MDL using weight pruning is not sufficiently motivated, and the specific threshold used for pruning is not justified with any theoretical or empirical analysis. The paper lacks a detailed comparison to other methods for estimating model complexity, such as those based on information theory or VC dimension, making it difficult to assess the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the analysis of the relationship between MDL and grokking is primarily correlational, and the paper does not provide any causal evidence that MDL reduction is a driver of grokking, rather than a consequence of it.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper should provide a more thorough justification for the choice of permutation tasks, explaining why these tasks are relevant for studying grokking and what specific insights they offer compared to other tasks. It would be beneficial to include a discussion of the limitations of these tasks and how the findings might generalize to more complex, real-world scenarios. The authors should also consider including experiments on a wider range of tasks to demonstrate the robustness of their findings. Furthermore, the paper needs to provide a more detailed explanation of the weight pruning method for estimating MDL. The authors should justify the choice of the specific pruning threshold, perhaps by showing how different thresholds affect the results. A comparison to other methods for estimating model complexity, such as those based on information theory or VC dimension, is necessary to properly contextualize the proposed approach. This comparison should include a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each method, and why the weight pruning method is particularly well-suited for studying grokking. The authors should also explore the possibility of using adaptive pruning techniques, where the pruning threshold is not fixed but changes during training. Finally, the paper needs to provide more evidence that MDL reduction is a driver of grokking, rather than a consequence of it. This could be achieved by conducting experiments where the MDL is explicitly controlled or manipulated, and then observing the effect on grokking. For example, the authors could try to train models with different initial MDL values and see how this affects the grokking behavior. The paper should also explore the possibility of using techniques from causal inference to establish a causal link between MDL reduction and grokking.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Could you provide more justification for the choice of permutation tasks and explain how they relate to real-world applications of neural networks?\n2. How did you determine the specific threshold for weight pruning when estimating MDL? Did you conduct any experiments to validate this choice?\n3. Have you compared your MDL estimation method to other existing methods for measuring model complexity? If so, what are the advantages and disadvantages of your approach compared to these methods?\n4. Do you have any evidence that MDL reduction is a driver of grokking, rather than just a consequence of it? Have you considered conducting experiments to establish a causal link between MDL reduction and grokking?\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 3\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper investigates the phenomenon of grokking in neural networks through the lens of Minimal Description Length (MDL), offering an information-theoretic perspective on sudden generalization.

The paper primarily focuses on modular arithmetic and permutation tasks, which may not fully represent the complexity and diversity of real-world problems. The generalizability of the findings to more complex tasks and larger-scale models needs further investigation. Specifically, the modular arithmetic tasks, while exhibiting grokking, are relatively simple algebraic operations, and it is unclear if the observed MDL transitions would generalize to tasks with more intricate data structures or requiring more sophisticated reasoning.\n2.

While the modular arithmetic and permutation tasks are useful for initial exploration, the authors should consider expanding their experiments to include more complex tasks that involve real-world data, such as image classification or natural language processing. This would help to determine if the observed relationship between MDL transitions and grokking points holds true in more realistic scenarios. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore the impact of different model architectures on the MDL transitions. For example, how do convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks behave in terms of MDL changes during grokking? Such investigations would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon and its applicability to different types of models and tasks.\n\nTo address the limitations of the proposed method, the authors should conduct a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the MDL estimation to various factors, such as the choice of pruning threshold, the specific pruning method, and the frequency of MDL calculation during training. It would be useful to explore different pruning techniques, such as magnitude-based pruning or gradient-based pruning, and compare their impact on the MDL transitions. Additionally, the authors should investigate the computational cost of tracking MDL during training, especially for large models, and propose strategies to mitigate this cost. For example, could the MDL be estimated using a subset of the network parameters or by approximating the pruning process? A more thorough analysis of these practical considerations would make the proposed method more robust and applicable to a wider range of scenarios.\n\nFinally, the paper would be significantly strengthened by a more detailed comparison with existing methods for analyzing grokking and sudden generalization. The authors should compare their MDL-based approach with methods that analyze the loss landscape, the neural tangent kernel, or other information-theoretic measures. This comparison should not only highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each approach but also provide a more complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms of grokking. For example, how do the MDL transitions relate to changes in the loss landscape or the evolution of the neural tangent kernel? Such a comparative analysis would help to position the proposed method within the broader context of research on sudden generalization and provide a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

The authors propose a novel approach to study grokking through the lens of Minimal Description Length (MDL), an information-theoretic principle that seeks to balance model complexity and data fitting. Their core idea is to track the MDL of a neural network during training using a weight pruning technique. Specifically, they define the MDL as the number of non-zero parameters in the model after applying a predefined threshold. By monitoring the changes in MDL alongside the validation accuracy, the authors aim to uncover the relationship between model compression and the emergence of generalization. The empirical evaluation focuses on four algorithmic tasks: modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation. The results indicate a strong correlation between MDL transitions, defined as points where the MDL decreases most rapidly, and grokking points, defined as the training step where the validation accuracy reaches 95%. This correlation is particularly evident in the modular arithmetic tasks, where the authors observe a clear connection between MDL reduction and the sudden improvement in generalization. The permutation task, however, presents a contrasting picture, with limited generalization performance despite some MDL reduction. The authors introduce new visualization techniques, such as scatter plots of MDL transition points versus grokking points and MDL transition rate plots, to further analyze the learning dynamics. Overall, the paper provides empirical evidence suggesting that MDL reduction may play a crucial role in the grokking phenomenon, offering a new perspective on sudden generalization in neural networks. However, the study is limited by the use of relatively simple algorithmic tasks and a lack of theoretical justification for the specific MDL estimation method and threshold used. The paper's main contribution lies in its novel application of MDL to study grokking and the empirical findings that suggest a link between model compression and generalization, but further research is needed to validate these findings on more complex tasks and to provide a more robust theoretical foundation.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThis paper presents a novel approach to investigating the grokking phenomenon by applying the principle of Minimal Description Length (MDL). The core strength lies in the innovative use of weight pruning as a practical method for estimating and tracking MDL during neural network training. This approach provides a quantitative measure of model compression, allowing for a detailed analysis of the relationship between MDL reduction and generalization. The authors' empirical findings, particularly the observed correlation between MDL transitions and grokking points in modular arithmetic tasks, offer compelling evidence for the potential role of model compression in sudden generalization. The introduction of new visualization techniques, such as the MDL Transition Point vs Grokking Point scatter plots and MDL Transition Rate plots, is another notable contribution. These visualizations provide valuable insights into the learning dynamics of neural networks and help to illustrate the connection between MDL changes and the emergence of generalization. Furthermore, the paper's focus on algorithmic tasks allows for a controlled environment to study grokking, which is a significant advantage. The clear definition of grokking points and MDL transition points enables a systematic analysis of the phenomenon. The paper also successfully connects the empirical findings to the broader theoretical framework of MDL, offering an information-theoretic perspective on sudden generalization. This perspective is valuable because it suggests that grokking may be related to the model's ability to find a compressed representation that generalizes well. Finally, the paper's clear and concise writing style makes it accessible and easy to follow, which is a significant strength in academic communication. The authors effectively present their methodology, results, and analysis in a logical and coherent manner, which enhances the overall impact of the paper. In summary, the paper's strengths lie in its novel methodology, compelling empirical findings, insightful visualizations, and clear presentation, all of which contribute to a better understanding of the grokking phenomenon.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile this paper presents an interesting approach to studying grokking, several weaknesses limit the strength of its conclusions. First, the choice of permutation tasks as a testbed for grokking is questionable. As noted by Reviewer 1, it is difficult to imagine this task being solved by a neural network in real-world applications, and the paper does not provide sufficient justification for its inclusion beyond stating that it is an algorithmic task. This lack of real-world relevance undermines the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the method for estimating MDL using weight pruning lacks a strong theoretical or empirical justification. The authors define MDL as the number of non-zero parameters after applying a threshold, but they do not explain why this specific method is suitable for estimating MDL, nor do they justify the choice of the threshold (10^-2). As Reviewer 1 points out, the paper does not provide any analysis of how different thresholds might affect the results. This lack of justification weakens the methodological foundation of the paper. The paper also lacks a detailed comparison to other methods for estimating model complexity. As Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 both note, the paper does not compare its weight pruning-based MDL estimation with other established methods, such as those based on information theory or VC dimension. This omission makes it difficult to assess the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Without such a comparison, it is unclear whether the observed MDL transitions are unique to the weight pruning method or if they would be captured by other model complexity measures. Moreover, the analysis of the relationship between MDL and grokking is primarily correlational. As Reviewer 1 correctly points out, the paper does not provide any causal evidence that MDL reduction is a driver of grokking, rather than a consequence of it. The experiments focus on observing the correlation between MDL changes and grokking but do not include experiments where MDL is explicitly controlled or manipulated. This lack of causal evidence limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the role of MDL in driving grokking. The paper also suffers from a limited scope of experimental evaluation. As Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 both note, the paper primarily focuses on modular arithmetic and permutation tasks, which are relatively simple compared to real-world problems. The generalizability of the findings to more complex tasks and larger-scale models is unclear. The modular arithmetic tasks, while exhibiting grokking, are relatively simple algebraic operations, and it is unclear if the observed MDL transitions would generalize to tasks with more intricate data structures or requiring more sophisticated reasoning. Additionally, the paper does not extensively discuss the limitations of the proposed method. As Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 point out, the sensitivity of the MDL estimation to the choice of pruning threshold and the specific pruning method is not thoroughly explored. Furthermore, the computational cost of tracking MDL during training, especially for large models, is not addressed. The paper also lacks a discussion on how the MDL estimation might be affected by different optimizers or learning rate schedules. Finally, the paper lacks a detailed comparison with other existing methods for analyzing grokking and sudden generalization. As Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 note, the paper does not compare its MDL-based approach with methods that analyze the loss landscape or the neural tangent kernel. This omission makes it difficult to position the proposed method within the broader context of research on sudden generalization. The paper also does not discuss how the proposed method relates to other information-theoretic measures of model complexity, such as the description length of the training data given the model. In summary, the paper's weaknesses stem from a lack of justification for the chosen tasks and MDL estimation method, a lack of causal evidence for the relationship between MDL and grokking, a limited scope of experimental evaluation, and a lack of comparison with existing methods. These weaknesses significantly limit the strength of the paper's conclusions.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should provide a more thorough justification for the choice of permutation tasks. They should explain why these tasks are relevant for studying grokking and what specific insights they offer compared to other tasks. It would be beneficial to include a discussion of the limitations of these tasks and how the findings might generalize to more complex, real-world scenarios. The authors should also consider including experiments on a wider range of tasks to demonstrate the robustness of their findings. Second, the paper needs to provide a more detailed explanation of the weight pruning method for estimating MDL. The authors should justify the choice of the specific pruning threshold, perhaps by showing how different thresholds affect the results. A sensitivity analysis of the MDL estimation to various hyperparameters, such as the pruning threshold, the specific pruning algorithm, and the frequency of MDL calculation during training, is crucial. A comparison to other methods for estimating model complexity, such as those based on information theory or VC dimension, is necessary to properly contextualize the proposed approach. This comparison should include a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each method, and why the weight pruning method is particularly well-suited for studying grokking. The authors should also explore the possibility of using adaptive pruning techniques, where the pruning threshold is not fixed but changes during training. Third, the paper needs to provide more evidence that MDL reduction is a driver of grokking, rather than just a consequence of it. This could be achieved by conducting experiments where the MDL is explicitly controlled or manipulated, and then observing the effect on grokking. For example, the authors could try to train models with different initial MDL values and see how this affects the grokking behavior. The paper should also explore the possibility of using techniques from causal inference to establish a causal link between MDL reduction and grokking. Fourth, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include more complex tasks that better reflect real-world scenarios. For example, image classification tasks on datasets like CIFAR-10 or natural language processing tasks on sentiment analysis datasets could provide a more robust assessment of the generalizability of the proposed MDL tracking method. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore the behavior of the MDL transitions across different model architectures, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks, to determine if the observed relationship between MDL reduction and grokking is consistent across various network types. Fifth, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the limitations of their method. This should include a discussion of the computational cost of tracking MDL, especially for large models, and propose strategies to mitigate this cost. For example, could the MDL be estimated using a subset of the network parameters or by approximating the pruning process? The authors should also investigate how different optimizers and learning rate schedules affect the MDL transitions and the grokking phenomenon. Finally, the paper would benefit from a more thorough comparison with existing methods for analyzing grokking and sudden generalization. This should include a discussion of how the proposed MDL-based approach relates to other information-theoretic measures of model complexity, such as the description length of the training data given the model. A comparison with methods that analyze the loss landscape or the neural tangent kernel would also be valuable. This would help to position the proposed method within the broader context of research on sudden generalization and provide a more nuanced understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. The authors should also discuss the potential for combining their approach with other methods to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the grokking phenomenon. By addressing these points, the authors can significantly strengthen their paper and provide a more robust and generalizable contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of this work. First, how does the proposed method for estimating and tracking MDL during neural network training using weight pruning techniques compare to other existing methods for measuring model complexity and generalization? Are there any similar approaches in the literature, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method compared to these approaches? Specifically, how does the weight pruning method relate to other information-theoretic measures of model complexity, such as the description length of the training data given the model? Second, the paper primarily focuses on modular arithmetic and permutation tasks. How do the findings generalize to more complex tasks and larger-scale models? Are there any plans to extend the experiments to other types of tasks and datasets, such as image classification or natural language processing? What specific challenges do the authors anticipate when applying their method to more complex scenarios? Third, what are the limitations of the proposed method, and what are the potential challenges in applying it to different tasks and model architectures? How sensitive is the MDL estimation to the choice of pruning threshold and the specific pruning method? What is the computational cost of tracking MDL during training, especially for large models? How might different optimizers or learning rate schedules affect the MDL transitions and the grokking phenomenon? Fourth, the paper mentions that the permutation task struggles to generalize, achieving only 33.93% validation accuracy in the best case. What are the potential reasons for this limited generalization performance? Are there any specific characteristics of the permutation task that make it more challenging for the model to generalize? How does the MDL behavior in the permutation task differ from that in the modular arithmetic tasks, and what might these differences indicate? Finally, the paper introduces new visualization techniques, such as MDL Transition Point vs Grokking Point scatter plots and MDL Transition Rate plots. How do these visualizations help in understanding the relationship between MDL transition points and grokking points? Are there any other visualization techniques that could be used to further analyze the learning dynamics of neural networks during grokking? What specific insights can be gained from these visualizations that would not be apparent from standard training curves? These questions aim to clarify the core methodological choices, assumptions, and limitations of the paper, and to encourage further exploration of the proposed approach.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper investigates the phenomenon of grokking in neural networks, which is characterized by a sudden improvement in generalization performance after a period of apparent memorization. The authors propose a novel approach to study grokking through the lens of Minimal Description Length (MDL), an information-theoretic principle that seeks to balance model complexity and data fitting. Their core idea is to track the MDL of a neural network during training using a weight pruning technique. Specifically, they define the MDL as the number of non-zero parameters in the model after applying a predefined threshold. By monitoring the changes in MDL alongside the validation accuracy, the authors aim to uncover the relationship between model compression and the emergence of generalization. The empirical evaluation focuses on four algorithmic tasks: modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation. The results indicate a strong correlation between MDL transitions, defined as points where the MDL decreases most rapidly, and grokking points, defined as the training step where the validation accuracy reaches 95%. This correlation is particularly evident in the modular arithmetic tasks, where the authors observe a clear connection between MDL reduction and the sudden improvement in generalization. The permutation task, however, presents a contrasting picture, with limited generalization performance despite some MDL reduction. The authors introduce new visualization techniques, such as scatter plots of MDL transition points versus grokking points and MDL transition rate plots, to further analyze the learning dynamics. Overall, the paper provides empirical evidence suggesting that MDL reduction may play a crucial role in the grokking phenomenon, offering a new perspective on sudden generalization in neural networks. However, the study is limited by the use of relatively simple algorithmic tasks and a lack of theoretical justification for the specific MDL estimation method and threshold used. The paper's main contribution lies in its novel application of MDL to study grokking and the empirical findings that suggest a link between model compression and generalization, but further research is needed to validate these findings on more complex tasks and to provide a more robust theoretical foundation.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThis paper presents a novel approach to investigating the grokking phenomenon by applying the principle of Minimal Description Length (MDL). The core strength lies in the innovative use of weight pruning as a practical method for estimating and tracking MDL during neural network training. This approach provides a quantitative measure of model compression, allowing for a detailed analysis of the relationship between MDL reduction and generalization. The authors' empirical findings, particularly the observed correlation between MDL transitions and grokking points in modular arithmetic tasks, offer compelling evidence for the potential role of model compression in sudden generalization. The introduction of new visualization techniques, such as the MDL Transition Point vs Grokking Point scatter plots and MDL Transition Rate plots, is another notable contribution. These visualizations provide valuable insights into the learning dynamics of neural networks and help to illustrate the connection between MDL changes and the emergence of generalization. Furthermore, the paper's focus on algorithmic tasks allows for a controlled environment to study grokking, which is a significant advantage. The clear definition of grokking points and MDL transition points enables a systematic analysis of the phenomenon. The paper also successfully connects the empirical findings to the broader theoretical framework of MDL, offering an information-theoretic perspective on sudden generalization. This perspective is valuable because it suggests that grokking may be related to the model's ability to find a compressed representation that generalizes well. Finally, the paper's clear and concise writing style makes it accessible and easy to follow, which is a significant strength in academic communication. The authors effectively present their methodology, results, and analysis in a logical and coherent manner, which enhances the overall impact of the paper. In summary, the paper's strengths lie in its novel methodology, compelling empirical findings, insightful visualizations, and clear presentation, all of which contribute to a better understanding of the grokking phenomenon.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile this paper presents an interesting approach to studying grokking, several weaknesses limit the strength of its conclusions. First, the choice of permutation tasks as a testbed for grokking is questionable. As noted by Reviewer 1, it is difficult to imagine this task being solved by a neural network in real-world applications, and the paper does not provide sufficient justification for its inclusion beyond stating that it is an algorithmic task. This lack of real-world relevance undermines the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the method for estimating MDL using weight pruning lacks a strong theoretical or empirical justification. The authors define MDL as the number of non-zero parameters after applying a threshold, but they do not explain why this specific method is suitable for estimating MDL, nor do they justify the choice of the threshold (10^-2). As Reviewer 1 points out, the paper does not provide any analysis of how different thresholds might affect the results. This lack of justification weakens the methodological foundation of the paper. The paper also lacks a detailed comparison to other methods for estimating model complexity. As Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 both note, the paper does not compare its weight pruning-based MDL estimation with other established methods, such as those based on information theory or VC dimension. This omission makes it difficult to assess the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Without such a comparison, it is unclear whether the observed MDL transitions are unique to the weight pruning method or if they would be captured by other model complexity measures. Moreover, the analysis of the relationship between MDL and grokking is primarily correlational. As Reviewer 1 correctly points out, the paper does not provide any causal evidence that MDL reduction is a driver of grokking, rather than a consequence of it. The experiments focus on observing the correlation between MDL changes and grokking but do not include experiments where MDL is explicitly controlled or manipulated. This lack of causal evidence limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the role of MDL in driving grokking. The paper also suffers from a limited scope of experimental evaluation. As Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 both note, the paper primarily focuses on modular arithmetic and permutation tasks, which are relatively simple compared to real-world problems. The generalizability of the findings to more complex tasks and larger-scale models is unclear. The modular arithmetic tasks, while exhibiting grokking, are relatively simple algebraic operations, and it is unclear if the observed MDL transitions would generalize to tasks with more intricate data structures or requiring more sophisticated reasoning. Additionally, the paper does not extensively discuss the limitations of the proposed method. As Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 point out, the sensitivity of the MDL estimation to the choice of pruning threshold and the specific pruning method is not thoroughly explored. Furthermore, the computational cost of tracking MDL during training, especially for large models, is not addressed. The paper also lacks a discussion on how the MDL estimation might be affected by different optimizers or learning rate schedules. Finally, the paper lacks a detailed comparison with other existing methods for analyzing grokking and sudden generalization. As Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 note, the paper does not compare its MDL-based approach with methods that analyze the loss landscape or the neural tangent kernel. This omission makes it difficult to position the proposed method within the broader context of research on sudden generalization. The paper also does not discuss how the proposed method relates to other information-theoretic measures of model complexity, such as the description length of the training data given the model. In summary, the paper's weaknesses stem from a lack of justification for the chosen tasks and MDL estimation method, a lack of causal evidence for the relationship between MDL and grokking, a limited scope of experimental evaluation, and a lack of comparison with existing methods. These weaknesses significantly limit the strength of the paper's conclusions.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should provide a more thorough justification for the choice of permutation tasks. They should explain why these tasks are relevant for studying grokking and what specific insights they offer compared to other tasks. It would be beneficial to include a discussion of the limitations of these tasks and how the findings might generalize to more complex, real-world scenarios. The authors should also consider including experiments on a wider range of tasks to demonstrate the robustness of their findings. Second, the paper needs to provide a more detailed explanation of the weight pruning method for estimating MDL. The authors should justify the choice of the specific pruning threshold, perhaps by showing how different thresholds affect the results. A sensitivity analysis of the MDL estimation to various hyperparameters, such as the pruning threshold, the specific pruning algorithm, and the frequency of MDL calculation during training, is crucial. A comparison to other methods for estimating model complexity, such as those based on information theory or VC dimension, is necessary to properly contextualize the proposed approach. This comparison should include a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each method, and why the weight pruning method is particularly well-suited for studying grokking. The authors should also explore the possibility of using adaptive pruning techniques, where the pruning threshold is not fixed but changes during training. Third, the paper needs to provide more evidence that MDL reduction is a driver of grokking, rather than just a consequence of it. This could be achieved by conducting experiments where the MDL is explicitly controlled or manipulated, and then observing the effect on grokking. For example, the authors could try to train models with different initial MDL values and see how this affects the grokking behavior. The paper should also explore the possibility of using techniques from causal inference to establish a causal link between MDL reduction and grokking. Fourth, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include more complex tasks that better reflect real-world scenarios. For example, image classification tasks on datasets like CIFAR-10 or natural language processing tasks on sentiment analysis datasets could provide a more robust assessment of the generalizability of the proposed MDL tracking method. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore the behavior of the MDL transitions across different model architectures, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks, to determine if the observed relationship between MDL reduction and grokking is consistent across various network types. Fifth, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the limitations of their method. This should include a discussion of the computational cost of tracking MDL, especially for large models, and propose strategies to mitigate this cost. For example, could the MDL be estimated using a subset of the network parameters or by approximating the pruning process? The authors should also investigate how different optimizers and learning rate schedules affect the MDL transitions and the grokking phenomenon. Finally, the paper would benefit from a more thorough comparison with existing methods for analyzing grokking and sudden generalization. This should include a discussion of how the proposed MDL-based approach relates to other information-theoretic measures of model complexity, such as the description length of the training data given the model. A comparison with methods that analyze the loss landscape or the neural tangent kernel would also be valuable. This would help to position the proposed method within the broader context of research on sudden generalization and provide a more nuanced understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. The authors should also discuss the potential for combining their approach with other methods to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the grokking phenomenon. By addressing these points, the authors can significantly strengthen their paper and provide a more robust and generalizable contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of this work. First, how does the proposed method for estimating and tracking MDL during neural network training using weight pruning techniques compare to other existing methods for measuring model complexity and generalization? Are there any similar approaches in the literature, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method compared to these approaches? Specifically, how does the weight pruning method relate to other information-theoretic measures of model complexity, such as the description length of the training data given the model?

How sensitive is the MDL estimation to the choice of pruning threshold and the specific pruning method? What is the computational cost of tracking MDL during training, especially for large models? How might different optimizers or learning rate schedules affect the MDL transitions and the grokking phenomenon? Fourth, the paper mentions that the permutation task struggles to generalize, achieving only 33.93% validation accuracy in the best case. What are the potential reasons for this limited generalization performance? Are there any specific characteristics of the permutation task that make it more challenging for the model to generalize? How does the MDL behavior in the permutation task differ from that in the modular arithmetic tasks, and what might these differences indicate? Finally, the paper introduces new visualization techniques, such as MDL Transition Point vs Grokking Point scatter plots and MDL Transition Rate plots. How do these visualizations help in understanding the relationship between MDL transition points and grokking points? Are there any other visualization techniques that could be used to further analyze the learning dynamics of neural networks during grokking? What specific insights can be gained from these visualizations that would not be apparent from standard training curves? These questions aim to clarify the core methodological choices, assumptions, and limitations of the paper, and to encourage further exploration of the proposed approach.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",

The idea of using data augmentation to understand grokking is interesting.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n[1] Progress measures for grokking via mechanistic interpretability.\n[2] Grokking: Generalization beyond overfitting on small algorithmic datasets.\n\n#### comment\n\nWhile the idea is interesting and well-executed, I am not convinced of the significance of the results. The main result is that data augmentation can accelerate grokking, but it is unclear how general this finding is. For example, it would be nice to see how the results vary with model size or different models altogether. Furthermore, the paper lacks a clear explanation of how the observed effects of data augmentation relate to existing theories of grokking. Specifically, the paper does not discuss how the proposed augmentation strategies might affect the progress measures proposed by Nanda et al. [1], such as the fraction of correct predictions on the training set or the norm of the gradient on the validation set. This makes it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms driving the observed acceleration of grokking. The paper also does not explore the effect of data augmentation on the training loss, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the training dynamics. Finally, the connection between the reversal augmentation and the commutative property is not well-motivated, as the model could learn this property from the data itself, as suggested by Power et al. [2].\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo strengthen the paper, the authors should investigate the generalizability of their findings across different model architectures and sizes. Specifically, they should explore how the effectiveness of data augmentation changes with varying numbers of layers and hidden dimensions in the transformer model. It would also be beneficial to examine the impact of data augmentation on different model architectures, such as MLPs or recurrent neural networks, to determine if the observed effects are specific to transformers or a more general phenomenon. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the training dynamics, including plots of the training loss alongside the validation accuracy. This would help to clarify the relationship between the training loss, data augmentation, and the onset of grokking. It would be particularly interesting to see if the data augmentation strategies that accelerate grokking also lead to faster convergence of the training loss or if they primarily affect the generalization performance. \n\nThe authors should also provide a more thorough discussion of how their findings relate to existing theories of grokking, particularly the progress measures proposed by Nanda et al. [1]. They should investigate whether the data augmentation strategies that accelerate grokking also lead to faster increases in the progress measures. For example, do these strategies lead to a faster increase in the fraction of correct predictions on the training set or a faster decrease in the norm of the gradient on the validation set? This would provide a more mechanistic understanding of how data augmentation influences the grokking phenomenon. Additionally, the authors should explore the effect of data augmentation on the learning trajectories of individual neurons or attention heads. This could provide further insights into the underlying mechanisms driving the observed effects. \n\nFinally, the authors should reconsider the motivation for the reversal augmentation. Instead of relying on the commutative property, they could explore other augmentation strategies that are more directly related to the structure of the modular arithmetic tasks. For example, they could investigate the effect of augmenting the data with different bases or moduli. This would provide a more direct link between the data augmentation and the task structure. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of why they expect the reversal augmentation to accelerate grokking. This would help to clarify the rationale behind this specific augmentation strategy and make the paper more convincing.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Why is the reversal augmentation expected to help? The reversal is related to the commutative property, but I'm unsure why this is the case as the model should be able to learn this from the data itself [2].\n2. Why is the validation accuracy for division with no augmentation so low? It seems low compared to subtraction, and both tasks appear quite similar.\n3. Why is the validation accuracy an appropriate metric to quantify grokking? It seems that grokking is more related to the training loss, as grokking occurs after the training loss has flattened [1, 2].\n4. It would be helpful to see plots of the training loss as well.\n\n[1] Nanda, Neel, et al. \"Progress measures for grokking via mechanistic interpretability.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.05217* (2023).\n\n[2] Power, Alethea, et al. \"Grokking: Generalization beyond overfitting on small algorithmic datasets.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.02177* (2022).\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper investigates the impact of data augmentation on grokking in the context of modular arithmetic tasks. The authors explore how different augmentation strategies, such as operand reversal and negation, affect the grokking phenomenon in a transformer model trained on operations like addition, subtraction, division, and permutation. The study finds that targeted data augmentation can significantly accelerate grokking, with negation being particularly effective. The authors also observe operation-specific effects and note that combined augmentation strategies can improve performance on tasks that are typically resistant to grokking.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n2\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper presents a systematic study of data augmentation techniques on grokking, providing empirical evidence of how specific augmentations can accelerate generalization in neural networks.\n\n2. The study is well-structured, with clear objectives, methodology, and experimental setup, making it easy to follow the authors' approach and findings.\n\n3. The findings offer practical insights for improving model training efficiency and generalization, which could be valuable for applications where computational resources are limited or faster convergence is needed.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The study focuses exclusively on modular arithmetic tasks, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other types of problems or datasets. The specific nature of modular arithmetic, with its discrete and cyclic properties, might not be representative of the challenges encountered in more complex or continuous domains. Therefore, it is unclear whether the observed acceleration of grokking due to data augmentation would translate to tasks involving real-valued data or more intricate relationships between inputs and outputs.\n\n2. The paper lacks a theoretical framework to explain why certain augmentations are more effective than others, which could limit the depth of understanding regarding the underlying mechanisms. While the empirical results demonstrate that negation and operand reversal can accelerate grokking, the absence of a theoretical explanation makes it difficult to predict which augmentations would be beneficial for other tasks. A theoretical analysis could provide insights into the interaction between the augmentation strategy and the learned representations, potentially revealing why certain augmentations are more effective for specific operations.\n\n3. The study does not explore the impact of data augmentation on grokking in more complex or real-world tasks, which could limit the broader applicability of the findings. The modular arithmetic tasks used in this study are relatively simple and do not capture the complexities of real-world problems. It is unclear whether the observed benefits of data augmentation would extend to tasks with higher dimensionality, more complex dependencies, or noisy data. Furthermore, the study does not investigate the potential trade-offs between the benefits of accelerated grokking and the computational cost of applying data augmentation, which could be a significant factor in real-world applications.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo strengthen the paper, the authors should consider expanding their investigation to include a wider range of tasks beyond modular arithmetic. This could involve exploring tasks with real-valued data, such as regression problems or time-series analysis, to assess the generalizability of their findings. Additionally, they could consider tasks with varying levels of complexity, such as those involving hierarchical structures or long-range dependencies, to determine the limitations of their approach. By including a more diverse set of tasks, the authors could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of data augmentation on grokking and its potential applicability to different problem domains. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore the impact of different data augmentation techniques, such as those that involve more complex transformations or combinations of transformations, to determine if there are other augmentation strategies that could be even more effective.\n\nDeveloping a theoretical framework to explain the observed effects of data augmentation on grokking would significantly enhance the paper's contribution. This could involve analyzing the impact of different augmentations on the loss landscape and the optimization process. For example, the authors could investigate how negation and operand reversal affect the symmetry of the loss function or the convergence properties of the optimization algorithm. A theoretical analysis could also provide insights into the relationship between the augmentation strategy and the learned representations, potentially revealing why certain augmentations are more effective for specific operations. This theoretical framework could be based on existing theories of generalization or optimization, or it could involve the development of new theoretical tools. Such a framework would not only deepen our understanding of the grokking phenomenon but also provide a basis for designing more effective augmentation strategies.\n\nFinally, the authors should explore the practical implications of their findings by investigating the impact of data augmentation on grokking in more complex or real-world tasks. This could involve applying their approach to tasks with higher dimensionality, more complex dependencies, or noisy data. Furthermore, they should investigate the potential trade-offs between the benefits of accelerated grokking and the computational cost of applying data augmentation. For example, they could analyze the impact of different augmentation strategies on the training time and the memory requirements. This would provide a more realistic assessment of the applicability of their approach and help to identify the most promising directions for future research. It would also be beneficial to explore the sensitivity of their results to different hyperparameter settings, such as the learning rate or the batch size, to ensure the robustness of their findings.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

The study focuses exclusively on modular arithmetic tasks, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other types of problems or datasets. While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of data augmentation in accelerating grokking for modular arithmetic, it remains unclear whether these results would hold for more complex tasks or datasets with different characteristics. The specific properties of modular arithmetic, such as its discrete nature and cyclical structure, might interact with the augmentation strategies in ways that are not generalizable to continuous or non-cyclical data.

Next, I will generate verification content for these reviews:\n\n\\boxed_verification{\nThe user wants me to validate weaknesses identified by reviewers in the provided paper. I need to go through each reviewer's comments and find evidence in the paper to support their claims.\n\nPlan:\n1. Read each reviewer's weakness.\n2. Find the corresponding section in the paper.\n3. Look for evidence (quotes, experimental details, missing citations, etc.) to support the weakness.\n4. If evidence is found, categorize it and note its impact.\n5. If no evidence is found, explain why the weakness is invalid.\n6. Synthesize the findings and provide a conclusion for each weakness.\n**Review 1 Weaknesses:**\n\n1. Weakness Statement: While the idea is interesting and well-executed, I am not convinced of the significance of the results. The main result is that data augmentation can accelerate grokking, but it is unclear how general this finding is. For example, it would be nice to see how the results vary with model size or different models altogether.\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\nb) Experiment-related Evidence:\n   - The paper focuses on a specific transformer architecture: \"We utilize a transformer model with the following specifications: - 2 transformer decoder layers, 128 hidden dimensions, 4 attention heads\" (Method, Model Architecture and Training).\n   - The experiments are conducted with this fixed architecture across all tasks and augmentation strategies.\n   - There is no exploration of different model sizes or architectures.\n\n3. Literature Gap Analysis:\n   - The paper does not cite or discuss literature on the impact of model size or architecture on grokking.\n\n4. Validation Analysis:\n   - The reviewer correctly points out the lack of exploration regarding the generalizability of the findings across different model sizes and architectures. The paper's experimental setup is limited to a single transformer configuration.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Validity status: Valid\n   - Confidence level: High\n   - Key supporting evidence: The paper explicitly states the fixed model architecture used for all experiments and lacks any experiments or discussion on varying model size or architecture.\n\n1. Weakness Statement: Furthermore, the paper lacks a clear explanation of how the observed effects of data augmentation relate to existing theories of grokking. Specifically, the paper does not discuss how the proposed augmentation strategies might affect the progress measures proposed by Nanda et al. [1], such as the fraction of correct predictions on the training set or the norm of the gradient on the validation set. This makes it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms driving the observed acceleration of grokking.\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\na) Method-related Evidence:\n   - The paper introduces data augmentation strategies (Operand Reversal, Operand Negation) and applies them to the training data (Method, Data Augmentation Strategies).\nb) Experiment-related Evidence:\n   - The paper reports metrics like \"Steps to 99% validation accuracy (S99)\" and \"Maximum rate of validation accuracy increase\" (Method, Evaluation Metrics).\n   - There is no explicit measurement or discussion of \"fraction of correct predictions on the training set\" or \"norm of the gradient on the validation set.\"\n3. Literature Gap Analysis:\n   - While the paper cites Nanda et al. (2023) in the Related Work section, it does not explicitly connect the observed effects of data augmentation to the progress measures proposed in that work.\n\n4. Validation Analysis:\n   - The reviewer accurately identifies the absence of a discussion linking the data augmentation strategies to specific progress measures of grokking as proposed by Nanda et al. The paper focuses on the impact on validation accuracy and training steps but doesn't delve into the underlying mechanisms using the suggested progress measures.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Validity status: Valid\n   - Confidence level: High\n   - Key supporting evidence: The paper's evaluation metrics do not include the progress measures mentioned by the reviewer, and there is no discussion on how the augmentations affect these measures.\n\n1. Weakness Statement: The paper also does not explore the effect of data augmentation on the training loss, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the training dynamics.\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\nb) Experiment-related Evidence:\n   - The paper mentions \"Final training and validation loss\" as an evaluation metric (Method, Evaluation Metrics).\n   - The results section includes \"Final training and validation loss\" in Table 1.\n   - However, the paper does not present training loss curves or a detailed analysis of how data augmentation affects the training loss dynamics.\n\n3. Literature Gap Analysis:\n   -  N/A\n\n4. Validation Analysis:\n   - While the paper reports the final training loss, the reviewer is correct that it doesn't explore the *dynamics* of the training loss throughout the training process, which is important for understanding the effect of data augmentation on the learning process.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Validity status: Partially Valid\n   - Confidence level: Medium\n   - Key supporting evidence: The paper reports the final training loss but lacks a detailed analysis or visualization of the training loss dynamics.\n\n1. Weakness Statement: Finally, the connection between the reversal augmentation and the commutative property is not well-motivated, as the model could learn this property from the data itself, as suggested by Power et al. [2].\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\na) Method-related Evidence:\n   - The paper states: \"Operand Reversal: For commutative operations (addition), we swap the positions of x and y with probability pr. This augmentation helps the model learn the commutative property: x + y ≡ y + x (mod p).\" (Method, Data Augmentation Strategies).\n   - The motivation is presented as explicitly teaching the commutative property.\n3. Literature Gap Analysis:\n   - The paper cites Power et al. (2022b) (referred to as [2] by the reviewer) in the Introduction and Related Work.\n\n4. Validation Analysis:\n   - The reviewer raises a valid point about the necessity of explicitly enforcing the commutative property through augmentation, given that models can learn such properties from data. The paper's motivation for this augmentation could be strengthened by acknowledging this possibility and providing further justification.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Validity status: Valid\n   - Confidence level: High\n   - Key supporting evidence: The paper's explanation for operand reversal focuses on explicitly teaching the commutative property, without discussing the possibility of the model learning it implicitly.\n\n**Review 1 Questions:**\n\n1. Question Statement: Why is the reversal augmentation expected to help? The reversal is related to the commutative property, but I'm unsure why this is the case as the model should be able to learn this from the data itself [2].\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\na) Method-related Evidence:\n   - As mentioned before, the paper states that the augmentation \"helps the model learn the commutative property\" (Method, Data Augmentation Strategies).\n\n3. Validation Analysis:\n   - This question directly relates to the previous weakness regarding the motivation for reversal augmentation. The paper's explanation is somewhat circular, assuming the benefit without fully justifying it in the context of the model's learning capabilities.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - This is a valid question stemming from a valid weakness.\n\n1. Question Statement: Why is the validation accuracy for division with no augmentation so low? It seems low compared to subtraction, and both tasks appear quite similar.\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\nb) Experiment-related Evidence:\n   - Table 1 shows \"Steps to 99% validation accuracy (S99)\" for Baseline: Addition (2363), Subtraction (4720), Division (4200).\n   - The paper does not explicitly discuss the relative difficulty of these operations without augmentation.\n\n3. Validation Analysis:\n   - The reviewer points out a discrepancy in the baseline performance. While the S99 for division is lower than subtraction, the final validation accuracy (bottom of the cells in Table 1) is the same (100%). The reviewer might be misinterpreting S99 as the final accuracy.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - Validity status: Invalid (Likely a misunderstanding of S99 vs. final accuracy)\n   - Confidence level: High\n   - Key supporting evidence: Table 1 shows the final validation accuracy for baseline division and subtraction is the same (100%).\n\n1. Question Statement: Why is the validation accuracy an appropriate metric to quantify grokking? It seems that grokking is more related to the training loss, as grokking occurs after the training loss has flattened [1, 2].\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\na) Method-related Evidence:\n   - The paper defines grokking as \"a sudden improvement in generalization performance after prolonged training\" (Motivation).\n   - The primary metric for quantifying grokking is \"Steps to 99% validation accuracy (S99)\" (Method, Evaluation Metrics).\n   - The paper also uses \"Maximum rate of validation accuracy increase\" to identify the onset of grokking (Method, Evaluation Metrics).\n   - The paper acknowledges that grokking occurs \"long after the training loss has plateaued\" (Motivation).\n\n3. Validation Analysis:\n   - The reviewer's understanding of grokking is consistent with the paper's definition. The paper uses validation accuracy as the primary metric to quantify the *outcome* of grokking (improved generalization), while acknowledging the training loss behavior is a characteristic of the phenomenon. The paper does not claim validation accuracy *causes* grokking, but rather it's a key indicator.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - Validity status: Invalid (The paper uses validation accuracy as a measure of the *result* of grokking, not the cause)\n   - Confidence level: High\n   - Key supporting evidence: The paper's definition of grokking and the use of validation accuracy as a measure of generalization performance.\n\n1. Question Statement: It would be helpful to see plots of the training loss as well.\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\nb) Experiment-related Evidence:\n   - The paper includes plots of validation accuracy over training steps (Figure 1).\n   - There are no plots of the training loss.\n\n3. Validation Analysis:\n   - This is a suggestion for improvement, aligning with the earlier identified weakness about the lack of exploration of training loss dynamics.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - This is a valid suggestion for improvement.\n\n**Review 2 Weaknesses:**\n\n1. Weakness Statement: The study focuses exclusively on modular arithmetic tasks, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other types of problems or datasets. The specific nature of modular arithmetic, with its discrete and cyclic properties, might not be representative of the challenges encountered in more complex or continuous domains. Therefore, it is unclear whether the observed acceleration of grokking due to data augmentation would translate to tasks involving real-valued data or more intricate relationships between inputs and outputs.\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\nb) Experiment-related Evidence:\n   - The paper explicitly states: \"In this paper, we investigate the impact of data augmentation techniques on grokking dynamics in the context of mathematical operations, specifically focusing on modular arithmetic tasks in Z97.\" (Introduction).\n   - All experiments are conducted on modular arithmetic tasks (addition, subtraction, division, permutation).\n\n3. Literature Gap Analysis:\n   - The paper does not include experiments or discussion on the generalizability of the findings to other types of tasks or datasets.\n\n4. Validation Analysis:\n   - The reviewer correctly identifies the limited scope of the experimental evaluation to modular arithmetic tasks, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Validity status: Valid\n   - Confidence level: High\n   - Key supporting evidence: The paper's explicit focus on modular arithmetic tasks and the absence of experiments on other types of tasks.\n\n1. Weakness Statement: The paper lacks a theoretical framework to explain why certain augmentations are more effective than others, which could limit the depth of understanding regarding the underlying mechanisms. While the empirical results demonstrate that negation and operand reversal can accelerate grokking, the absence of a theoretical explanation makes it difficult to predict which augmentations would be beneficial for other tasks.

The authors explore how different augmentation strategies, specifically operand reversal and negation, affect the speed at which neural networks achieve high generalization performance, as measured by validation accuracy. The core methodology involves training a transformer model on various modular arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, division, and permutation, both with and without the application of these data augmentation techniques. The primary finding is that targeted data augmentation can significantly accelerate grokking, with negation proving particularly effective across several tasks. The study also observes that the effectiveness of augmentation strategies is task-dependent, with some augmentations benefiting certain operations while hindering others. For instance, while negation generally speeds up grokking, operand reversal aids addition but appears to impede subtraction. The authors introduce the metric 'Steps to 99% validation accuracy (S99)' to quantify grokking speed and use this metric to compare the performance of different augmentation strategies. The paper's significance lies in its exploration of a practical approach to manipulating the grokking phenomenon, offering insights into how data augmentation can be used to enhance model training efficiency and generalization capabilities. The study provides a systematic analysis of the interplay between data augmentation and grokking, contributing to our understanding of this intriguing aspect of neural network learning. However, the study is limited by its focus on a specific model architecture and a narrow range of tasks, which raises questions about the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the paper lacks a theoretical framework to explain the observed effects, which limits the depth of our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Despite these limitations, the paper offers a valuable empirical contribution to the growing body of research on grokking and provides a foundation for future investigations into the role of data augmentation in this phenomenon.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe paper's primary strength lies in its systematic empirical investigation of data augmentation techniques on grokking, a phenomenon that remains not fully understood. The authors have clearly defined their research question and have executed a well-structured experimental plan. The use of modular arithmetic tasks provides a controlled environment for studying grokking, allowing for a focused analysis of the impact of data augmentation. The introduction of the 'Steps to 99% validation accuracy (S99)' metric is a valuable contribution, providing a clear and quantifiable measure of grokking speed. This metric allows for a direct comparison of the effectiveness of different augmentation strategies. The paper's exploration of operand reversal and negation as data augmentation techniques is insightful, demonstrating that these techniques can significantly accelerate grokking in certain tasks. The finding that negation is particularly effective in speeding up grokking is a notable contribution. Furthermore, the paper's observation that the effectiveness of augmentation strategies is task-dependent is an important finding, highlighting the nuanced relationship between data augmentation and the grokking phenomenon. The authors' careful analysis of the impact of augmentation on different modular arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, division, and permutation, provides a comprehensive view of the interplay between these factors. The paper is also well-written and easy to understand, making it accessible to a broad audience. The clear presentation of the methodology, experimental setup, and results facilitates the replication and extension of this work. The paper's focus on practical strategies for enhancing model training efficiency and generalization capabilities is also a significant strength, making the findings relevant to the broader machine learning community. The authors have successfully demonstrated that data augmentation can be a powerful tool for manipulating the grokking phenomenon, opening up new avenues for research in this area. The paper's empirical contributions are substantial, providing a solid foundation for future investigations into the role of data augmentation in grokking.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite its strengths, the paper suffers from several significant weaknesses that limit the scope and generalizability of its findings. A primary concern is the narrow focus of the experimental evaluation. The study exclusively uses a single transformer architecture, specifically a 2-layer transformer decoder with 128 hidden dimensions and 4 attention heads, for all experiments. This lack of variation in model architecture raises questions about whether the observed effects of data augmentation are specific to this particular configuration. As the paper states, 'We utilize a transformer model with the following specifications: - 2 transformer decoder layers, 128 hidden dimensions, 4 attention heads' (Method, Model Architecture and Training). The paper does not explore how the effectiveness of data augmentation might change with varying numbers of layers or hidden dimensions, nor does it consider other model architectures such as MLPs or recurrent neural networks. This limitation is significant because it is unclear whether the observed acceleration of grokking due to data augmentation would generalize to different model types or sizes. This is a critical limitation because the grokking phenomenon itself might be influenced by the model's capacity and architecture. The paper also lacks a theoretical framework to explain the observed effects of data augmentation on grokking. While the authors demonstrate empirically that negation and operand reversal can accelerate grokking, they do not provide a theoretical explanation for why these augmentations are effective. The paper introduces the augmentation strategies but does not delve into the underlying mechanisms. As the paper states, 'Operand Reversal: For commutative operations (addition), we swap the positions of x and y with probability pr. This augmentation helps the model learn the commutative property' (Method, Data Augmentation Strategies). This lack of theoretical grounding makes it difficult to predict which augmentations would be beneficial for other tasks or datasets. For instance, the paper does not explain why operand reversal helps with addition but hinders subtraction. This absence of a theoretical framework limits the depth of our understanding of the grokking phenomenon and the role of data augmentation in it. Furthermore, the paper's experimental evaluation is limited to modular arithmetic tasks. While these tasks provide a controlled environment for studying grokking, they may not be representative of the challenges encountered in more complex or real-world scenarios. The paper explicitly states, 'In this paper, we investigate the impact of data augmentation techniques on grokking dynamics in the context of mathematical operations, specifically focusing on modular arithmetic tasks in Z97' (Introduction). The specific properties of modular arithmetic, such as its discrete nature and cyclical structure, might interact with the augmentation strategies in ways that are not generalizable to continuous or non-cyclical data. For example, the effectiveness of operand reversal might be tied to the commutative property inherent in modular addition, which may not be present in other tasks. The paper does not explore the impact of data augmentation on grokking in more complex or real-world tasks, which limits the broader applicability of the findings. The paper also does not explore the impact of data augmentation on the training loss dynamics. While the paper reports the final training loss, it does not present training loss curves or a detailed analysis of how data augmentation affects the training loss throughout the training process. This is a significant omission because the training loss is a crucial aspect of understanding the training dynamics and the effect of data augmentation on the learning process. The paper mentions 'Final training and validation loss' as an evaluation metric (Method, Evaluation Metrics) and includes these in Table 1, but it does not explore the *dynamics* of the training loss. Finally, the paper does not investigate the potential trade-offs between the benefits of accelerated grokking and the computational cost of applying data augmentation. The paper does not discuss the computational overhead associated with the proposed augmentation techniques, which could be a significant factor in real-world applications. This omission is important because the computational cost of data augmentation might outweigh the benefits of accelerated grokking in some cases. All of these weaknesses are supported by the paper's content and are significant limitations to the conclusions that can be drawn from this study. My confidence in these limitations is high, as they are directly observable from the paper's methodology and experimental setup.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should expand their investigation to include a wider range of model architectures and sizes. This would involve exploring how the effectiveness of data augmentation changes with varying numbers of layers and hidden dimensions in the transformer model. It would also be beneficial to examine the impact of data augmentation on different model architectures, such as MLPs or recurrent neural networks, to determine if the observed effects are specific to transformers or a more general phenomenon. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the generalizability of the findings. Second, the authors should develop a theoretical framework to explain the observed effects of data augmentation on grokking. This could involve analyzing the impact of different augmentations on the loss landscape and the optimization process. For example, the authors could investigate how negation and operand reversal affect the symmetry of the loss function or the convergence properties of the optimization algorithm. A theoretical analysis could also provide insights into the relationship between the augmentation strategy and the learned representations, potentially revealing why certain augmentations are more effective for specific operations. This theoretical framework could be based on existing theories of generalization or optimization, or it could involve the development of new theoretical tools. Such a framework would not only deepen our understanding of the grokking phenomenon but also provide a basis for designing more effective augmentation strategies. Third, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include a wider range of tasks beyond modular arithmetic. This could involve exploring tasks with real-valued data, such as regression problems or time-series analysis, to assess the generalizability of their findings. Additionally, they could consider tasks with varying levels of complexity, such as those involving hierarchical structures or long-range dependencies, to determine the limitations of their approach. By including a more diverse set of tasks, the authors could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of data augmentation on grokking and its potential applicability to different problem domains. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore the impact of different data augmentation techniques, such as those that involve more complex transformations or combinations of transformations, to determine if there are other augmentation strategies that could be even more effective. Fourth, the authors should include a detailed analysis of the training loss dynamics. This would involve presenting training loss curves alongside the validation accuracy curves to provide a more complete picture of the training process. This would help to clarify the relationship between the training loss, data augmentation, and the onset of grokking. It would be particularly interesting to see if the data augmentation strategies that accelerate grokking also lead to faster convergence of the training loss or if they primarily affect the generalization performance. Finally, the authors should investigate the potential trade-offs between the benefits of accelerated grokking and the computational cost of applying data augmentation. This would involve analyzing the impact of different augmentation strategies on the training time and the memory requirements. This would provide a more realistic assessment of the applicability of their approach and help to identify the most promising directions for future research. It would also be beneficial to explore the sensitivity of their results to different hyperparameter settings, such as the learning rate or the batch size, to ensure the robustness of their findings. These suggestions are directly connected to the identified weaknesses and are aimed at strengthening the paper's conclusions and generalizability.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nSeveral key questions arise from my analysis of this paper, focusing on the core methodological choices and assumptions. First, how do the authors anticipate their findings will generalize to more complex or real-world tasks beyond modular arithmetic? Given the specific properties of modular arithmetic, it is unclear whether the observed acceleration of grokking due to data augmentation would translate to tasks involving real-valued data or more intricate relationships between inputs and outputs. This question is crucial for assessing the broader applicability of the study's findings. Second, can the authors provide any theoretical insights or hypotheses about why certain augmentations are more effective for specific operations? While the paper demonstrates empirically that negation and operand reversal can accelerate grokking, it lacks a theoretical explanation for these observations. A theoretical framework would be essential for predicting which augmentations would be beneficial for new tasks or datasets. Third, how sensitive are the results to different hyperparameter settings or model architectures, and could this affect the generalizability of the findings? The paper uses a fixed transformer architecture for all experiments, and it is unclear whether the observed effects of data augmentation would hold for different model sizes or architectures. This question is important for understanding the robustness of the findings. Fourth, what is the computational overhead associated with the proposed data augmentation techniques, and how does this overhead compare to the benefits of accelerated grokking? The paper does not discuss the computational cost of applying data augmentation, which could be a significant factor in real-world applications. This question is crucial for assessing the practical feasibility of the proposed approach. Fifth, why is the reversal augmentation expected to help, given that the model should be able to learn the commutative property from the data itself? The paper's motivation for this augmentation could be strengthened by acknowledging this possibility and providing further justification. These questions target the core uncertainties and limitations of the study, seeking clarification of critical assumptions and methodological choices.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

The main result is that data augmentation can accelerate grokking, but it is unclear how general this finding is. For example, it would be nice to see how the results vary with model size or different models altogether. Furthermore, the paper lacks a clear explanation of how the observed effects of data augmentation relate to existing theories of grokking. Specifically, the paper does not discuss how the proposed augmentation strategies might affect the progress measures proposed by Nanda et al. [1], such as the fraction of correct predictions on the training set or the norm of the gradient on the validation set. This makes it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms driving the observed acceleration of grokking. The paper also does not explore the effect of data augmentation on the training loss, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the training dynamics. Finally, the connection between the reversal augmentation and the commutative property is not well-motivated, as the model could learn this property from the data itself, as suggested by Power et al. [2].\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo strengthen the paper, the authors should investigate the generalizability of their findings across different model architectures and sizes.

[1]. They should investigate whether the data augmentation strategies that accelerate grokking also lead to faster increases in the progress measures. For example, do these strategies lead to a faster increase in the fraction of correct predictions on the training set or a faster decrease in the norm of the gradient on the validation set? This would provide a more mechanistic understanding of how data augmentation influences the grokking phenomenon. Additionally, the authors should explore the effect of data augmentation on the learning trajectories of individual neurons or attention heads. This could provide further insights into the underlying mechanisms driving the observed effects. \n\nFinally, the authors should reconsider the motivation for the reversal augmentation. Instead of relying on the commutative property, they could explore other augmentation strategies that are more directly related to the structure of the modular arithmetic tasks. For example, they could investigate the effect of augmenting the data with different bases or moduli. This would provide a more direct link between the data augmentation and the task structure. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of why they expect the reversal augmentation to accelerate grokking. This would help to clarify the rationale behind this specific augmentation strategy and make the paper more convincing.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Why is the reversal augmentation expected to help? The reversal is related to the commutative property, but I'm unsure why this is the case as the model should be able to learn this from the data itself [2].\n2. Why is the validation accuracy for division with no augmentation so low? It seems low compared to subtraction, and both tasks appear quite similar.\n3. Why is the validation accuracy an appropriate metric to quantify grokking? It seems that grokking is more related to the training loss, as grokking occurs after the training loss has flattened [1, 2].\n4. It would be helpful to see plots of the training loss as well.\n\n[1] Nanda, Neel, et al. \"Progress measures for grokking via mechanistic interpretability.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.05217* (2023).\n\n[2] Power, Alethea, et al. \"Grokking: Generalization beyond overfitting on small algorithmic datasets.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.02177* (2022).\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********"

The paper presents a systematic study of data augmentation strategies and their effects on grokking, providing empirical evidence of how specific augmentations can accelerate generalization in neural networks.\n2.

The study focuses exclusively on modular arithmetic tasks, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other types of problems or datasets. While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of data augmentation in accelerating grokking for modular arithmetic, it remains unclear whether these results would hold for more complex tasks or datasets with different characteristics. The specific properties of modular arithmetic, such as its discrete nature and cyclical structure, might interact with the augmentation strategies in ways that are not generalizable to continuous or non-cyclical data. For instance, the effectiveness of operand reversal might be tied to the commutative property inherent in modular addition, which may not be present in other tasks.\n2. The paper lacks a theoretical framework to explain why certain augmentations are more effective than others, which could limit the depth of understanding regarding the underlying mechanisms. The empirical results show that negation is particularly effective, but the paper does not provide a theoretical explanation for this observation. A theoretical analysis could help to understand the relationship between the augmentation strategy and the learned representations, and could potentially lead to the development of more effective augmentation techniques. Without such a framework, it is difficult to predict which augmentations would be beneficial for new tasks or datasets.\n3. The study does not explore the impact of data augmentation on grokking in more complex or real-world tasks, which could limit the broader applicability of the findings. The modular arithmetic tasks used in this study are relatively simple and do not capture the complexities of real-world problems. It is unclear whether the observed benefits of data augmentation would extend to tasks with higher dimensionality, more complex dependencies, or noisy data. Furthermore, the study does not investigate the potential trade-offs between the benefits of accelerated grokking and the computational cost of applying data augmentation, which could be a significant factor in real-world applications.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo strengthen the paper, the authors should consider expanding their investigation to include a wider range of tasks beyond modular arithmetic. This could involve exploring tasks with real-valued data, such as regression problems or time-series analysis, to assess the generalizability of their findings. Additionally, they could consider tasks with varying levels of complexity, such as those involving hierarchical structures or long-range dependencies, to determine the limitations of their approach. By including a more diverse set of tasks, the authors could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of data augmentation on grokking and its potential applicability to different problem domains. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore the impact of different data augmentation techniques, such as those that involve more complex transformations or combinations of transformations, to determine if there are other augmentation strategies that could be even more effective.\n\nDeveloping a theoretical framework to explain the observed effects of data augmentation on grokking would significantly enhance the paper's contribution. This could involve analyzing the impact of different augmentations on the loss landscape and the optimization process. For example, the authors could investigate how negation and operand reversal affect the symmetry of the loss function or the convergence properties of the optimization algorithm. A theoretical analysis could also provide insights into the relationship between the augmentation strategy and the learned representations, potentially revealing why certain augmentations are more effective for specific operations. This theoretical framework could be based on existing theories of generalization or optimization, or it could involve the development of new theoretical tools. Such a framework would not only deepen our understanding of the grokking phenomenon but also provide a basis for designing more effective augmentation strategies.\n\nFinally, the authors should explore the practical implications of their findings by investigating the impact of data augmentation on grokking in more complex or real-world tasks. This could involve applying their approach to tasks with higher dimensionality, more complex dependencies, or noisy data. Furthermore, they should investigate the potential trade-offs between the benefits of accelerated grokking and the computational cost of applying data augmentation. For example, they could analyze the impact of different augmentation strategies on the training time and the memory requirements. This would provide a more realistic assessment of the applicability of their approach and help to identify the most promising directions for future research. It would also be beneficial to explore the sensitivity of their results to different hyperparameter settings, such as the learning rate or the batch size, to ensure the robustness of their findings.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper presents an empirical investigation into the impact of data augmentation on the grokking phenomenon within the context of modular arithmetic tasks. The authors explore how different augmentation strategies, specifically operand reversal and negation, affect the speed at which neural networks achieve high generalization performance, as measured by validation accuracy. The core methodology involves training a transformer model on various modular arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, division, and permutation, both with and without the application of these data augmentation techniques. The primary finding is that targeted data augmentation can significantly accelerate grokking, with negation proving particularly effective across several tasks. The study also observes that the effectiveness of augmentation strategies is task-dependent, with some augmentations benefiting certain operations while hindering others. For instance, while negation generally speeds up grokking, operand reversal aids addition but appears to impede subtraction. The authors introduce the metric 'Steps to 99% validation accuracy (S99)' to quantify grokking speed and use this metric to compare the performance of different augmentation strategies. The paper's significance lies in its exploration of a practical approach to manipulating the grokking phenomenon, offering insights into how data augmentation can be used to enhance model training efficiency and generalization capabilities. The study provides a systematic analysis of the interplay between data augmentation and grokking, contributing to our understanding of this intriguing aspect of neural network learning. However, the study is limited by its focus on a specific model architecture and a narrow range of tasks, which raises questions about the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the paper lacks a theoretical framework to explain the observed effects, which limits the depth of our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Despite these limitations, the paper offers a valuable empirical contribution to the growing body of research on grokking and provides a foundation for future investigations into the role of data augmentation in this phenomenon.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe paper's primary strength lies in its systematic empirical investigation of data augmentation techniques on grokking, a phenomenon that remains not fully understood. The authors have clearly defined their research question and have executed a well-structured experimental plan. The use of modular arithmetic tasks provides a controlled environment for studying grokking, allowing for a focused analysis of the impact of data augmentation. The introduction of the 'Steps to 99% validation accuracy (S99)' metric is a valuable contribution, providing a clear and quantifiable measure of grokking speed. This metric allows for a direct comparison of the effectiveness of different augmentation strategies. The paper's exploration of operand reversal and negation as data augmentation techniques is insightful, demonstrating that these techniques can significantly accelerate grokking in certain tasks. The finding that negation is particularly effective in speeding up grokking is a notable contribution. Furthermore, the paper's observation that the effectiveness of augmentation strategies is task-dependent is an important finding, highlighting the nuanced relationship between data augmentation and the grokking phenomenon. The authors' careful analysis of the impact of augmentation on different modular arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, division, and permutation, provides a comprehensive view of the interplay between these factors. The paper is also well-written and easy to understand, making it accessible to a broad audience. The clear presentation of the methodology, experimental setup, and results facilitates the replication and extension of this work. The paper's focus on practical strategies for enhancing model training efficiency and generalization capabilities is also a significant strength, making the findings relevant to the broader machine learning community. The authors have successfully demonstrated that data augmentation can be a powerful tool for manipulating the grokking phenomenon, opening up new avenues for research in this area. The paper's empirical contributions are substantial, providing a solid foundation for future investigations into the role of data augmentation in grokking.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite its strengths, the paper suffers from several significant weaknesses that limit the scope and generalizability of its findings. A primary concern is the narrow focus of the experimental evaluation. The study exclusively uses a single transformer architecture, specifically a 2-layer transformer decoder with 128 hidden dimensions and 4 attention heads, for all experiments. This lack of variation in model architecture raises questions about whether the observed effects of data augmentation are specific to this particular configuration. As the paper states, 'We utilize a transformer model with the following specifications: - 2 transformer decoder layers, 128 hidden dimensions, 4 attention heads' (Method, Model Architecture and Training). The paper does not explore how the effectiveness of data augmentation might change with varying numbers of layers or hidden dimensions, nor does it consider other model architectures such as MLPs or recurrent neural networks. This limitation is significant because it is unclear whether the observed acceleration of grokking due to data augmentation would generalize to different model types or sizes. This is a critical limitation because the grokking phenomenon itself might be influenced by the model's capacity and architecture. The paper also lacks a theoretical framework to explain the observed effects of data augmentation on grokking. While the authors demonstrate empirically that negation and operand reversal can accelerate grokking, they do not provide a theoretical explanation for why these augmentations are effective. The paper introduces the augmentation strategies but does not delve into the underlying mechanisms. As the paper states, 'Operand Reversal: For commutative operations (addition), we swap the positions of x and y with probability pr. This augmentation helps the model learn the commutative property' (Method, Data Augmentation Strategies). This lack of theoretical grounding makes it difficult to predict which augmentations would be beneficial for other tasks or datasets. For instance, the paper does not explain why operand reversal helps with addition but hinders subtraction. This absence of a theoretical framework limits the depth of our understanding of the grokking phenomenon and the role of data augmentation in it. Furthermore, the paper's experimental evaluation is limited to modular arithmetic tasks. While these tasks provide a controlled environment for studying grokking, they may not be representative of the challenges encountered in more complex or real-world scenarios. The paper explicitly states, 'In this paper, we investigate the impact of data augmentation techniques on grokking dynamics in the context of mathematical operations, specifically focusing on modular arithmetic tasks in Z97' (Introduction). The specific properties of modular arithmetic, such as its discrete nature and cyclical structure, might interact with the augmentation strategies in ways that are not generalizable to continuous or non-cyclical data. For example, the effectiveness of operand reversal might be tied to the commutative property inherent in modular addition, which may not be present in other tasks. The paper does not explore the impact of data augmentation on grokking in more complex or real-world tasks, which limits the broader applicability of the findings. The paper also does not explore the impact of data augmentation on the training loss dynamics. While the paper reports the final training loss, it does not present training loss curves or a detailed analysis of how data augmentation affects the training loss throughout the training process. This is a significant omission because the training loss is a crucial aspect of understanding the training dynamics and the effect of data augmentation on the learning process. The paper mentions 'Final training and validation loss' as an evaluation metric (Method, Evaluation Metrics) and includes these in Table 1, but it does not explore the *dynamics* of the training loss. Finally, the paper does not investigate the potential trade-offs between the benefits of accelerated grokking and the computational cost of applying data augmentation. The paper does not discuss the computational overhead associated with the proposed augmentation techniques, which could be a significant factor in real-world applications. This omission is important because the computational cost of data augmentation might outweigh the benefits of accelerated grokking in some cases. All of these weaknesses are supported by the paper's content and are significant limitations to the conclusions that can be drawn from this study. My confidence in these limitations is high, as they are directly observable from the paper's methodology and experimental setup.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should expand their investigation to include a wider range of model architectures and sizes. This would involve exploring how the effectiveness of data augmentation changes with varying numbers of layers and hidden dimensions in the transformer model. It would also be beneficial to examine the impact of data augmentation on different model architectures, such as MLPs or recurrent neural networks, to determine if the observed effects are specific to transformers or a more general phenomenon. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the generalizability of the findings. Second, the authors should develop a theoretical framework to explain the observed effects of data augmentation on grokking. This could involve analyzing the impact of different augmentations on the loss landscape and the optimization process.

Fourth, the authors should include a detailed analysis of the training loss dynamics. This would involve presenting training loss curves alongside the validation accuracy curves to provide a more complete picture of the training process. This would help to clarify the relationship between the training loss, data augmentation, and the onset of grokking. It would be particularly interesting to see if the data augmentation strategies that accelerate grokking also lead to faster convergence of the training loss or if they primarily affect the generalization performance. Finally, the authors should investigate the potential trade-offs between the benefits of accelerated grokking and the computational cost of applying data augmentation. This would involve analyzing the impact of different augmentation strategies on the training time and the memory requirements.

First, how do the authors anticipate their findings will generalize to more complex or real-world tasks beyond modular arithmetic? Given the specific properties of modular arithmetic, it is unclear whether the observed acceleration of grokking due to data augmentation would translate to tasks involving real-valued data or more intricate relationships between inputs and outputs.

Second, can the authors provide any theoretical insights or hypotheses about why certain augmentations are more effective for specific operations? While the paper demonstrates empirically that negation and operand reversal can accelerate grokking, it lacks a theoretical explanation for these observations. A theoretical framework would be essential for predicting which augmentations would be beneficial for new tasks or datasets. Third, how sensitive are the results to different hyperparameter settings or model architectures, and could this affect the generalizability of the findings? The paper uses a fixed transformer architecture for all experiments, and it is unclear whether the observed effects of data augmentation would hold for different model sizes or architectures. This question is important for understanding the robustness of the findings. Fourth, what is the computational overhead associated with the proposed data augmentation techniques, and how does this overhead compare to the benefits of accelerated grokking? The paper does not discuss the computational cost of applying data augmentation, which could be a significant factor in real-world applications. This question is crucial for assessing the practical feasibility of the proposed approach. Fifth, why is the reversal augmentation expected to help, given that the model should be able to learn the commutative property from the data itself? The paper's motivation for this augmentation could be strengthened by acknowledging this possibility and providing further justification. These questions target the core uncertainties and limitations of the study, seeking clarification of critical assumptions and methodological choices.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",

It fails to provide a compelling argument for why this is an important problem to address. Additionally, the concept of \"style\" remains undefined, and it is unclear what specific styles the proposed method is intended to capture. The paper does not articulate why existing language models are insufficient in this regard, nor does it specify the limitations of current models in capturing stylistic variations. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the practical relevance of the proposed approach.\n- The paper does not address how the style labels are obtained for training the style classifier. It only mentions that \"the style classification head dynamically infers the style of the input sequence,\" without providing details on the training data and process. It is unclear whether the style labels are derived from the dataset itself or if an external annotation process is used. The paper also fails to explain how the style classifier is trained to identify styles, and what specific features are used for style classification. This lack of detail makes it difficult to evaluate the validity of the style classification process.\n- The evaluation setup lacks clarity, particularly regarding the baseline used for comparison. It is unclear how the baseline is trained and evaluated, and whether it is a fair comparison to the proposed method. The paper does not specify if the baseline is a standard language model without any style adaptation mechanisms. Furthermore, the evaluation does not include a comparison with other existing style-aware language models, making it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed method. The absence of a clear baseline and comparison with existing methods limits the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the experimental results.\n- The experimental results do not demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The baseline achieves better validation loss than the proposed method on all datasets, indicating that the proposed method compromises language modeling performance for style consistency. The paper does not provide a clear trade-off analysis between language modeling performance and style consistency. The evaluation also does not include a quantitative measure of style diversity, making it difficult to assess whether the model is simply memorizing style patterns or if it is truly generating diverse stylistic variations. The lack of a clear trade-off analysis and style diversity metrics limits the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper needs to clearly define what is meant by \"style\" in the context of language modeling. This definition should be specific and measurable, allowing for a clear understanding of what the model is intended to capture. For example, if the style refers to author-specific writing characteristics, the paper should explicitly state this and provide a method for quantifying these characteristics. The paper should also articulate why existing language models are insufficient in capturing these stylistic variations. This could involve discussing the limitations of current models in maintaining consistent style across long sequences or in adapting to different styles within the same model. The motivation for introducing style awareness should be compelling and grounded in practical applications, such as personalized text generation or style transfer. Without a clear definition and motivation, the significance of the proposed method remains unclear.\n\nThe paper should provide a detailed explanation of how the style labels are obtained for training the style classifier. This explanation should include the source of the labels, the process of label generation, and the specific features used for style classification. If the labels are derived from the dataset itself, the paper should clarify how this is done and what assumptions are made. For example, if the dataset is divided into chunks and each chunk is assigned a unique style label, the paper should explain the rationale behind this approach and its limitations. The paper should also describe the training process of the style classifier, including the loss function and optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the potential limitations of the style classifier, such as its ability to generalize to unseen styles or its sensitivity to noise in the style labels. A clear and detailed explanation of the style labeling process is crucial for the reproducibility and validity of the proposed method.\n\nThe evaluation setup needs to be significantly improved to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed method. The paper should clearly specify the baseline model used for comparison, including its architecture, training data, and training procedure. If the baseline is a standard language model without any style adaptation mechanisms, this should be explicitly stated. The evaluation should also include a comparison with other existing style-aware language models, if available, to assess the relative performance of the proposed method. Furthermore, the evaluation should include a quantitative measure of style diversity, such as the number of distinct styles generated by the model or the entropy of the style distribution. The paper should also provide a trade-off analysis between language modeling performance and style consistency, demonstrating the benefits and limitations of the proposed method. The evaluation should be designed to answer the question of whether the proposed method achieves better style consistency without sacrificing language modeling performance, and if so, under what conditions.\n\n### Questions\n\n- What is the motivation for introducing style awareness in language models? What does \"style\" mean in this context? Why are existing language models insufficient in this regard?\n- How are the style labels obtained for training the style classifier? Is an auxiliary style classifier trained on synthetic data, and if so, what is the training process?\n- What is the baseline model used for comparison? How is it trained and evaluated?\n- How does the proposed method demonstrate its superiority over existing language models? What is the trade-off between language modeling performance and style consistency?\n\n### Rating\n\n1\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes a Multi-style Adapter for character-level language models to enable the model to generate text in multiple styles while maintaining consistency within each style. The Multi-style Adapter consists of learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and a StyleAdapter module that modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style. The approach is implemented by modifying the GPT architecture and incorporating style adaptation after every transformer layer. The paper evaluates the proposed method on three datasets: shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8. The main contribution is a novel approach to enhance style awareness and consistency in character-level language models, achieving high style consistency scores while maintaining competitive language modeling performance.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n3\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper proposes a novel Multi-style Adapter architecture that enhances style awareness and consistency in character-level language models.

The paper is well-organized and clearly written. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the proposed method, including the architecture of the Multi-style Adapter and the training process. The experimental setup and results are presented in a clear and concise manner.\n3. The paper addresses an important problem in natural language generation, which is the ability to generate text in diverse and consistent styles. This capability has significant implications for various applications, such as creative writing assistance and personalized content generation.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method. While the authors mention that the Multi-style Adapter results in slower inference speeds, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the adapter. Specifically, the paper lacks a breakdown of the additional parameters, FLOPs, and memory access patterns introduced by the style adapter, making it difficult to assess the practical scalability of the approach. A comparison of these metrics with the baseline GPT model would be beneficial.\n2. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the scalability of the proposed method to larger language models and datasets. The experiments are conducted on relatively small models and datasets, and it is unclear how the method would perform when applied to larger models with billions of parameters and massive datasets. The paper should discuss potential bottlenecks and challenges in scaling the proposed method, such as increased memory requirements and training time.\n3. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the robustness of the proposed method to noisy or adversarial inputs. The paper should include experiments that evaluate the model's performance when presented with inputs that contain errors, inconsistencies, or adversarial perturbations. This is crucial for assessing the practical applicability of the method in real-world scenarios where inputs may not be perfectly clean.\n4. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the interpretability of the learned style embeddings and the StyleAdapter module. While the paper mentions that the style embeddings capture diverse writing styles, it does not provide any visualization or analysis of these embeddings to understand what specific stylistic features they capture. Similarly, the paper lacks an analysis of how the StyleAdapter module modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style. This makes it difficult to understand the inner workings of the proposed method.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo address the lack of computational complexity analysis, the authors should provide a detailed breakdown of the computational overhead introduced by the Multi-style Adapter. This should include a comparison of the number of parameters, FLOPs, and memory access patterns between the baseline GPT model and the proposed method. The authors should also analyze the impact of the style adapter on the inference speed and provide a breakdown of the time spent in different parts of the model. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore techniques to reduce the computational overhead of the style adapter, such as using low-rank approximations or pruning. This analysis should be performed for different model sizes to understand how the overhead scales with model size.\n\nTo address the scalability concerns, the authors should conduct experiments on larger language models and datasets.

Furthermore, the authors should explore techniques to improve the scalability of the method, such as distributed training or model parallelism. The paper should also include a discussion of the limitations of the proposed method in terms of scalability and potential future research directions.\n\nTo address the lack of robustness analysis, the authors should conduct experiments that evaluate the model's performance when presented with noisy or adversarial inputs. This should include an analysis of the model's ability to maintain style consistency and language modeling performance when presented with inputs that contain errors, inconsistencies, or adversarial perturbations. The authors should also explore techniques to improve the robustness of the model, such as data augmentation or adversarial training. Furthermore, the paper should include a discussion of the limitations of the proposed method in terms of robustness and potential future research directions. Finally, to improve interpretability, the authors should provide visualizations and analysis of the learned style embeddings to understand what specific stylistic features they capture. This could include techniques such as t-SNE or PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings and visualize them in a 2D or 3D space. The authors should also analyze the attention patterns of the StyleAdapter module to understand how it modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method? How does the computational overhead of the Multi-style Adapter scale with the size of the language model and the number of styles?\n2.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a Multi-Style Adapter, a novel approach designed to enhance style awareness and consistency in character-level language models. The core idea revolves around integrating learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and a StyleAdapter module into the GPT architecture. This adapter modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style, aiming to generate text that is not only coherent but also stylistically consistent. The method is implemented by modifying the GPT architecture, incorporating style adaptation after every transformer layer, which allows for a fine-grained control over the style of generated text. The authors evaluate their approach on three datasets: Shakespeare's works (shakespeare_char), enwik8, and text8, demonstrating improved validation losses and high style consistency across generated samples. The experimental results indicate that the Multi-Style Adapter achieves lower validation losses compared to a baseline GPT model, suggesting better generalization performance. Furthermore, the style consistency scores are near-perfect across all datasets, demonstrating the model's ability to maintain consistent styles throughout generated text. However, this improvement comes at the cost of reduced inference speed, which is an expected trade-off due to the increased computational complexity of the Multi-Style Adapter. The paper also includes an ablation study and visualizations of learned style embeddings and attention patterns, providing further insights into the model's behavior. Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of style-aware language modeling by introducing a novel architecture that effectively balances style adaptation and language modeling capabilities within a single model. The approach is well-motivated, clearly described, and empirically validated, making it a valuable addition to the literature. However, there are several limitations that warrant further investigation, particularly regarding the potential for overfitting, the trade-off between style consistency and diversity, the computational overhead, and the lack of comparison with existing style-aware language models. These limitations, which I will discuss in detail, highlight areas for future research and improvement.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe primary strength of this paper lies in its introduction of the Multi-Style Adapter, a novel architecture that effectively integrates style awareness into character-level language models. The approach is innovative in its use of learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and a StyleAdapter module that modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style. This design allows for a fine-grained control over the style of generated text, which is a significant advancement in the field. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the methodology and results. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the proposed method, including the architecture of the Multi-Style Adapter and the training process. The experimental setup and results are presented in a clear and concise manner, and the inclusion of an ablation study and visualizations of learned style embeddings and attention patterns further enhances the paper's clarity and depth. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower validation losses compared to a baseline GPT model, indicating better generalization performance. The style consistency scores are also near-perfect across all datasets, demonstrating the model's ability to maintain consistent styles throughout generated text. This is a significant achievement, as it addresses a key challenge in style-aware language modeling. The paper also provides a clear motivation for introducing style awareness in language models, highlighting the importance of generating text in diverse and consistent styles for applications such as creative writing assistance and personalized content generation. The authors also acknowledge the limitations of current methods, such as reliance on predefined style categories and the need for separate models, which further underscores the significance of their contribution. The integration of the style adaptation after every transformer layer is another notable technical innovation, allowing for stronger style-specific representations throughout the model. This design choice enhances both style awareness and consistency, which is a key advantage of the proposed method. Finally, the paper's focus on character-level language models is also a strength, as it addresses a specific and challenging area of research. The ability to generate text with style consistency at the character level is a significant achievement, and the proposed method provides a valuable contribution to this area.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, there are several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of the limitations of the Multi-Style Adapter, particularly regarding the potential for overfitting to specific style patterns. While the authors acknowledge in the conclusion that the perfect consistency scores on enwik8 and text8 datasets may indicate overfitting, they do not provide a detailed analysis or experiments to investigate the extent of this issue. The paper does not explore how the model might be memorizing style-specific tokens rather than learning generalizable style representations. This is a significant concern, as it could limit the model's ability to generate diverse text within each style. Furthermore, the evaluation does not explore the model's ability to generalize to unseen style variations within the same dataset, focusing primarily on style consistency across different datasets. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to assess the model's robustness and practical applicability. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper itself acknowledges the potential for overfitting, and the lack of specific experiments to address this concern is evident. Second, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the trade-off between style consistency and diversity in generated text. The current evaluation focuses primarily on consistency, but it's crucial to understand how the adapter affects the range of stylistic variations the model can produce. The paper does not include any quantitative analysis of style diversity, such as metrics like entropy or self-BLEU on style-specific generated text. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to assess whether the model is simply collapsing to a single style, even within a given style category. The paper should also discuss the potential for the model to collapse to a single style and how this might be mitigated. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper explicitly mentions 'style consistency' as an evaluation metric but lacks any quantitative analysis of style diversity. Third, the paper should provide a more in-depth analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the Multi-Style Adapter. While the authors mention reduced inference speed, a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with each component of the adapter (style embeddings, classification head, and StyleAdapter module) is missing. The paper does not provide a comparison of the number of parameters or FLOPs with and without the adapter, nor does it discuss how these costs scale with the number of styles. Furthermore, the paper does not discuss the impact of the adapter on memory usage during training and inference. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to assess the practical scalability of the approach. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper states the reduced inference speed but lacks a detailed analysis of computational complexity, parameters, FLOPs, and memory access patterns compared to the baseline. Fourth, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing style-aware language models. While the authors mention some related work, a more detailed comparison, including quantitative results, would help to contextualize the contributions of this work. The comparison should not only focus on overall performance but also on specific aspects such as style consistency, style diversity, and computational efficiency. The paper should include a comparison with models that use different approaches to style control, such as conditional language models or models that use style tokens. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper discusses related work qualitatively but lacks a quantitative comparison with existing style-aware language models. Fifth, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the scalability of the proposed method to larger language models and datasets. The experiments are conducted on relatively small models and datasets, and it is unclear how the method would perform when applied to larger models with billions of parameters and massive datasets. The paper should discuss potential bottlenecks and challenges in scaling the proposed method, such as increased memory requirements and training time. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the experiments are conducted on a fixed-size model and datasets, and the paper lacks analysis or discussion on the scalability of the method to larger models and datasets. Sixth, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the robustness of the proposed method to noisy or adversarial inputs. The paper should include experiments that evaluate the model's performance when presented with inputs that contain errors, inconsistencies, or adversarial perturbations. This is crucial for assessing the practical applicability of the method in real-world scenarios where inputs may not be perfectly clean. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper describes experiments on standard datasets but lacks any evaluation of the model's robustness to noisy or adversarial inputs. Finally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the interpretability of the learned style embeddings and the StyleAdapter module. While the paper mentions that the style embeddings capture diverse writing styles, it does not provide any visualization or analysis of these embeddings to understand what specific stylistic features they capture. Similarly, the paper lacks an analysis of how the StyleAdapter module modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style. This makes it difficult to understand the inner workings of the proposed method. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper describes the purpose of style embeddings and the StyleAdapter but lacks detailed analysis or visualizations to interpret their learned representations and effects on hidden states.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, to mitigate the risk of overfitting and improve generalization, the authors should conduct a more rigorous analysis of the model's behavior on held-out portions of the training data, specifically focusing on style variations not seen during training. This could involve creating subsets of the datasets with specific style variations and evaluating the model's performance on these subsets. Furthermore, the authors should explore techniques to encourage the model to learn more generalizable style representations, such as data augmentation or regularization methods. The analysis should also include a qualitative assessment of the generated text, examining whether the model is producing repetitive or stereotypical style patterns. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's ability to generalize to unseen style variations. Second, to better understand the trade-off between style consistency and diversity, the authors should incorporate quantitative metrics for style diversity into their evaluation. This could include calculating the entropy of the style distribution in generated text or using self-BLEU scores to measure the similarity between different samples generated with the same style. The authors should also investigate the potential for the model to collapse to a single style and explore techniques to mitigate this, such as adding a diversity-promoting loss term during training. A detailed analysis of the generated text, examining the range of stylistic variations produced by the model, would also be beneficial. This analysis should include examples of both successful and unsuccessful style generation, providing insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses. Third, to address the lack of computational complexity analysis, the authors should provide a detailed breakdown of the computational overhead introduced by the Multi-Style Adapter. This should include a comparison of the number of parameters, FLOPs, and memory access patterns between the baseline GPT model and the proposed method. The authors should also analyze the impact of the style adapter on the inference speed and provide a breakdown of the time spent in different parts of the model. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore techniques to reduce the computational overhead of the style adapter, such as using low-rank approximations or pruning. This analysis should be performed for different model sizes to understand how the overhead scales with model size. Fourth, to address the lack of comparison with existing style-aware language models, the authors should provide a more detailed comparison, including quantitative results and a discussion of the specific strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This comparison should not only focus on overall performance but also on specific aspects such as style consistency, style diversity, and computational efficiency. The authors should also discuss the limitations of their approach in comparison to other methods, highlighting the trade-offs involved. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the contributions of this work and its place within the broader field of style-aware language modeling. The comparison should include models that use different approaches to style control, such as conditional language models or models that use style tokens, to provide a more complete picture of the landscape. Fifth, to address the scalability concerns, the authors should conduct experiments on larger language models and datasets. This should include an analysis of the training time, memory requirements, and performance of the proposed method when applied to models with billions of parameters and massive datasets. The authors should also discuss potential bottlenecks and challenges in scaling the proposed method, such as increased memory requirements and training time. Furthermore, the authors should explore techniques to improve the scalability of the method, such as distributed training or model parallelism. The paper should also include a discussion of the limitations of the proposed method in terms of scalability and potential future research directions. Sixth, to address the lack of robustness analysis, the authors should conduct experiments that evaluate the model's performance when presented with noisy or adversarial inputs. This should include an analysis of the model's ability to maintain style consistency and language modeling performance when presented with inputs that contain errors, inconsistencies, or adversarial perturbations. The authors should also explore techniques to improve the robustness of the model, such as data augmentation or adversarial training. Furthermore, the paper should include a discussion of the limitations of the proposed method in terms of robustness and potential future research directions. Finally, to improve interpretability, the authors should provide visualizations and analysis of the learned style embeddings to understand what specific stylistic features they capture. This could include techniques such as t-SNE or PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings and visualize them in a 2D or 3D space. The authors should also analyze the attention patterns of the StyleAdapter module to understand how it modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe would be beneficial for further clarification and understanding of the proposed method. First, how does the Multi-Style Adapter perform on datasets with a larger number of distinct styles? The current experiments are conducted on datasets with a limited number of styles, and it would be valuable to understand how the model scales to scenarios with a more diverse range of stylistic variations. Second, can the authors provide more details on the computational overhead introduced by the Multi-Style Adapter? How does this overhead scale with the size of the language model and the number of styles? A detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with each component of the adapter would be valuable for assessing the practical scalability of the approach. Third, how does the Multi-Style Adapter compare to other style-aware language models in terms of style consistency, diversity, and computational efficiency? A more detailed comparison, including quantitative results, would help to contextualize the contributions of this work and its place within the broader field of style-aware language modeling. Fourth, what are the potential applications of the Multi-Style Adapter beyond the datasets used in this paper? How might this approach be used in real-world scenarios requiring style-aware text generation? Exploring the practical applications of the method would further highlight its significance and potential impact. Fifth, what is the motivation for introducing style awareness in language models? While the paper provides some motivation, a more explicit definition of 'style' in the context of language modeling would be beneficial. What specific stylistic features are the authors aiming to capture, and why are existing language models insufficient in this regard? Sixth, how are the style labels obtained for training the style classifier? Is an auxiliary style classifier trained on synthetic data, and if so, what is the training process? A detailed explanation of the style labeling process is crucial for the reproducibility and validity of the proposed method. Seventh, what is the baseline model used for comparison? How is it trained and evaluated? While the paper mentions that the baseline is a standard GPT model, more details on its training procedure would be helpful. Finally, can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the robustness of the proposed method to noisy or adversarial inputs? How does the method perform when presented with inputs that contain errors, inconsistencies, or adversarial perturbations? This is crucial for assessing the practical applicability of the method in real-world scenarios where inputs may not be perfectly clean.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

The main components include a style embedding table, a style classifier, and a StyleAdapter module that is applied after every transformer block. The proposed method is evaluated on three character-level language modeling datasets: shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8. Experimental results demonstrate a trade-off between language modeling performance and style consistency, as the proposed method achieves higher style consistency at the cost of reduced language modeling performance compared to the baseline.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n1\n\n### Contribution\n\n1\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The proposed method is described in detail, making it easy to understand and reproduce.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n - The paper lacks a clear motivation for introducing style awareness in language models. It fails to provide a compelling argument for why this is an important problem to address. Additionally, the concept of \"style\" remains undefined, and it is unclear what specific styles the proposed method is intended to capture. The paper does not articulate why existing language models are insufficient in this regard, nor does it specify the limitations of current models in capturing stylistic variations. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the practical relevance of the proposed approach.\n- The paper does not address how the style labels are obtained for training the style classifier. It only mentions that \"the style classification head dynamically infers the style of the input sequence,\" without providing details on the training data and process. It is unclear whether the style labels are derived from the dataset itself or if an external annotation process is used. The paper also fails to explain how the style classifier is trained to identify styles, and what specific features are used for style classification. This lack of detail makes it difficult to evaluate the validity of the style classification process.\n- The evaluation setup lacks clarity, particularly regarding the baseline used for comparison. It is unclear how the baseline is trained and evaluated, and whether it is a fair comparison to the proposed method. The paper does not specify if the baseline is a standard language model without any style adaptation mechanisms. Furthermore, the evaluation does not include a comparison with other existing style-aware language models, making it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed method. The absence of a clear baseline and comparison with existing methods limits the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the experimental results.\n- The experimental results do not demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The baseline achieves better validation loss than the proposed method on all datasets, indicating that the proposed method compromises language modeling performance for style consistency. The paper does not provide a clear trade-off analysis between language modeling performance and style consistency. The evaluation also does not include a quantitative measure of style diversity, making it difficult to assess whether the model is simply memorizing style patterns or if it is truly generating diverse stylistic variations. The lack of a clear trade-off analysis and style diversity metrics limits the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper needs to clearly define what is meant by \"style\" in the context of language modeling. This definition should be specific and measurable, allowing for a clear understanding of what the model is intended to capture. For example, if the style refers to author-specific writing characteristics, the paper should explicitly state this and provide a method for quantifying these characteristics. The paper should also articulate why existing language models are insufficient in capturing these stylistic variations. This could involve discussing the limitations of current models in maintaining consistent style across long sequences or in adapting to different styles within the same model. The motivation for introducing style awareness should be compelling and grounded in practical applications, such as personalized text generation or style transfer. Without a clear definition and motivation, the significance of the proposed method remains unclear.\n\nThe paper should provide a detailed explanation of how the style labels are obtained for training the style classifier. This explanation should include the source of the labels, the process of label generation, and the specific features used for style classification. If the labels are derived from the dataset itself, the paper should clarify how this is done and what assumptions are made. For example, if the dataset is divided into chunks and each chunk is assigned a unique style label, the paper should explain the rationale behind this approach and its limitations. The paper should also describe the training process of the style classifier, including the loss function and optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the potential limitations of the style classifier, such as its ability to generalize to unseen styles or its sensitivity to noise in the style labels. A clear and detailed explanation of the style labeling process is crucial for the reproducibility and validity of the proposed method.\n\nThe evaluation setup needs to be significantly improved to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed method. The paper should clearly specify the baseline model used for comparison, including its architecture, training data, and training procedure. If the baseline is a standard language model without any style adaptation mechanisms, this should be explicitly stated. The evaluation should also include a comparison with other existing style-aware language models, if available, to assess the relative performance of the proposed method. Furthermore, the evaluation should include a quantitative measure of style diversity, such as the number of distinct styles generated by the model or the entropy of the style distribution. The paper should also provide a trade-off analysis between language modeling performance and style consistency, demonstrating the benefits and limitations of the proposed method. The evaluation should be designed to answer the question of whether the proposed method achieves better style consistency without sacrificing language modeling performance, and if so, under what conditions.\n\n### Questions\n\n- What is the motivation for introducing style awareness in language models?

This adapter modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style, aiming to generate text that is not only coherent but also stylistically consistent. The method is implemented by modifying the GPT architecture, incorporating style adaptation after every transformer layer, which allows for a fine-grained control over the style of generated text. The authors evaluate their approach on three datasets: Shakespeare's works (shakespeare_char), enwik8, and text8, demonstrating improved validation losses and high style consistency across generated samples. The experimental results indicate that the Multi-Style Adapter achieves lower validation losses compared to a baseline GPT model, suggesting better generalization performance. Furthermore, the style consistency scores are near-perfect across all datasets, demonstrating the model's ability to maintain consistent styles throughout generated text. However, this improvement comes at the cost of reduced inference speed, which is an expected trade-off due to the increased computational complexity of the Multi-Style Adapter. The paper also includes an ablation study and visualizations of learned style embeddings and attention patterns, providing further insights into the model's behavior. Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of style-aware language modeling by introducing a novel architecture that effectively balances style adaptation and language modeling capabilities within a single model. The approach is well-motivated, clearly described, and empirically validated, making it a valuable addition to the literature. However, there are several limitations that warrant further investigation, particularly regarding the potential for overfitting, the trade-off between style consistency and diversity, the computational overhead, and the lack of comparison with existing style-aware language models. These limitations, which I will discuss in detail, highlight areas for future research and improvement.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe primary strength of this paper lies in its introduction of the Multi-Style Adapter, a novel architecture that effectively integrates style awareness into character-level language models. The approach is innovative in its use of learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and a StyleAdapter module that modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style. This design allows for a fine-grained control over the style of generated text, which is a significant advancement in the field. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the methodology and results. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the proposed method, including the architecture of the Multi-Style Adapter and the training process. The experimental setup and results are presented in a clear and concise manner, and the inclusion of an ablation study and visualizations of learned style embeddings and attention patterns further enhances the paper's clarity and depth. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower validation losses compared to a baseline GPT model, indicating better generalization performance. The style consistency scores are also near-perfect across all datasets, demonstrating the model's ability to maintain consistent styles throughout generated text. This is a significant achievement, as it addresses a key challenge in style-aware language modeling. The paper also provides a clear motivation for introducing style awareness in language models, highlighting the importance of generating text in diverse and consistent styles for applications such as creative writing assistance and personalized content generation. The authors also acknowledge the limitations of current methods, such as reliance on predefined style categories and the need for separate models, which further underscores the significance of their contribution. The integration of the style adaptation after every transformer layer is another notable technical innovation, allowing for stronger style-specific representations throughout the model. This design choice enhances both style awareness and consistency, which is a key advantage of the proposed method. Finally, the paper's focus on character-level language models is also a strength, as it addresses a specific and challenging area of research. The ability to generate text with style consistency at the character level is a significant achievement, and the proposed method provides a valuable contribution to this area.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, there are several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of the limitations of the Multi-Style Adapter, particularly regarding the potential for overfitting to specific style patterns. While the authors acknowledge in the conclusion that the perfect consistency scores on enwik8 and text8 datasets may indicate overfitting, they do not provide a detailed analysis or experiments to investigate the extent of this issue. The paper does not explore how the model might be memorizing style-specific tokens rather than learning generalizable style representations. This is a significant concern, as it could limit the model's ability to generate diverse text within each style. Furthermore, the evaluation does not explore the model's ability to generalize to unseen style variations within the same dataset, focusing primarily on style consistency across different datasets. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to assess the model's robustness and practical applicability. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper itself acknowledges the potential for overfitting, and the lack of specific experiments to address this concern is evident. Second, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the trade-off between style consistency and diversity in generated text. The current evaluation focuses primarily on consistency, but it's crucial to understand how the adapter affects the range of stylistic variations the model can produce. The paper does not include any quantitative analysis of style diversity, such as metrics like entropy or self-BLEU on style-specific generated text. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to assess whether the model is simply collapsing to a single style, even within a given style category. The paper should also discuss the potential for the model to collapse to a single style and how this might be mitigated. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper explicitly mentions 'style consistency' as an evaluation metric but lacks any quantitative analysis of style diversity. Third, the paper should provide a more in-depth analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the Multi-Style Adapter. While the authors mention reduced inference speed, a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with each component of the adapter (style embeddings, classification head, and StyleAdapter module) is missing. The paper does not provide a comparison of the number of parameters or FLOPs with and without the adapter, nor does it discuss how these costs scale with the number of styles. Furthermore, the paper does not discuss the impact of the adapter on memory usage during training and inference. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to assess the practical scalability of the approach. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper states the reduced inference speed but lacks a detailed analysis of computational complexity, parameters, FLOPs, and memory access patterns compared to the baseline. Fourth, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing style-aware language models. While the authors mention some related work, a more detailed comparison, including quantitative results, would help to contextualize the contributions of this work. The comparison should not only focus on overall performance but also on specific aspects such as style consistency, style diversity, and computational efficiency. The paper should include a comparison with models that use different approaches to style control, such as conditional language models or models that use style tokens. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper discusses related work qualitatively but lacks a quantitative comparison with existing style-aware language models. Fifth, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the scalability of the proposed method to larger language models and datasets. The experiments are conducted on relatively small models and datasets, and it is unclear how the method would perform when applied to larger models with billions of parameters and massive datasets. The paper should discuss potential bottlenecks and challenges in scaling the proposed method, such as increased memory requirements and training time. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the experiments are conducted on a fixed-size model and datasets, and the paper lacks analysis or discussion on the scalability of the method to larger models and datasets. Sixth, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the robustness of the proposed method to noisy or adversarial inputs. The paper should include experiments that evaluate the model's performance when presented with inputs that contain errors, inconsistencies, or adversarial perturbations. This is crucial for assessing the practical applicability of the method in real-world scenarios where inputs may not be perfectly clean. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper describes experiments on standard datasets but lacks any evaluation of the model's robustness to noisy or adversarial inputs. Finally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the interpretability of the learned style embeddings and the StyleAdapter module. While the paper mentions that the style embeddings capture diverse writing styles, it does not provide any visualization or analysis of these embeddings to understand what specific stylistic features they capture. Similarly, the paper lacks an analysis of how the StyleAdapter module modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style. This makes it difficult to understand the inner workings of the proposed method. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper describes the purpose of style embeddings and the StyleAdapter but lacks detailed analysis or visualizations to interpret their learned representations and effects on hidden states.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, to mitigate the risk of overfitting and improve generalization, the authors should conduct a more rigorous analysis of the model's behavior on held-out portions of the training data, specifically focusing on style variations not seen during training. This could involve creating subsets of the datasets with specific style variations and evaluating the model's performance on these subsets. Furthermore, the authors should explore techniques to encourage the model to learn more generalizable style representations, such as data augmentation or regularization methods. The analysis should also include a qualitative assessment of the generated text, examining whether the model is producing repetitive or stereotypical style patterns. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's ability to generalize to unseen style variations. Second, to better understand the trade-off between style consistency and diversity, the authors should incorporate quantitative metrics for style diversity into their evaluation. This could include calculating the entropy of the style distribution in generated text or using self-BLEU scores to measure the similarity between different samples generated with the same style. The authors should also investigate the potential for the model to collapse to a single style and explore techniques to mitigate this, such as adding a diversity-promoting loss term during training. A detailed analysis of the generated text, examining the range of stylistic variations produced by the model, would also be beneficial. This analysis should include examples of both successful and unsuccessful style generation, providing insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses. Third, to address the lack of computational complexity analysis, the authors should provide a detailed breakdown of the computational overhead introduced by the Multi-Style Adapter. This should include a comparison of the number of parameters, FLOPs, and memory access patterns between the baseline GPT model and the proposed method. The authors should also analyze the impact of the style adapter on the inference speed and provide a breakdown of the time spent in different parts of the model. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore techniques to reduce the computational overhead of the style adapter, such as using low-rank approximations or pruning. This analysis should be performed for different model sizes to understand how the overhead scales with model size. Fourth, to address the lack of comparison with existing style-aware language models, the authors should provide a more detailed comparison, including quantitative results and a discussion of the specific strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This comparison should not only focus on overall performance but also on specific aspects such as style consistency, style diversity, and computational efficiency. The authors should also discuss the limitations of their approach in comparison to other methods, highlighting the trade-offs involved. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the contributions of this work and its place within the broader field of style-aware language modeling. The comparison should include models that use different approaches to style control, such as conditional language models or models that use style tokens, to provide a more complete picture of the landscape. Fifth, to address the scalability concerns, the authors should conduct experiments on larger language models and datasets. This should include an analysis of the training time, memory requirements, and performance of the proposed method when applied to models with billions of parameters and massive datasets. The authors should also discuss potential bottlenecks and challenges in scaling the proposed method, such as increased memory requirements and training time. Furthermore, the authors should explore techniques to improve the scalability of the method, such as distributed training or model parallelism. The paper should also include a discussion of the limitations of the proposed method in terms of scalability and potential future research directions. Sixth, to address the lack of robustness analysis, the authors should conduct experiments that evaluate the model's performance when presented with noisy or adversarial inputs. This should include an analysis of the model's ability to maintain style consistency and language modeling performance when presented with inputs that contain errors, inconsistencies, or adversarial perturbations. The authors should also explore techniques to improve the robustness of the model, such as data augmentation or adversarial training. Furthermore, the paper should include a discussion of the limitations of the proposed method in terms of robustness and potential future research directions. Finally, to improve interpretability, the authors should provide visualizations and analysis of the learned style embeddings to understand what specific stylistic features they capture. This could include techniques such as t-SNE or PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings and visualize them in a 2D or 3D space. The authors should also analyze the attention patterns of the StyleAdapter module to understand how it modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe would be beneficial for further clarification and understanding of the proposed method. First, how does the Multi-Style Adapter perform on datasets with a larger number of distinct styles? The current experiments are conducted on datasets with a limited number of styles, and it would be valuable to understand how the model scales to scenarios with a more diverse range of stylistic variations. Second, can the authors provide more details on the computational overhead introduced by the Multi-Style Adapter? How does this overhead scale with the size of the language model and the number of styles? A detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with each component of the adapter would be valuable for assessing the practical scalability of the approach. Third, how does the Multi-Style Adapter compare to other style-aware language models in terms of style consistency, diversity, and computational efficiency? A more detailed comparison, including quantitative results, would help to contextualize the contributions of this work and its place within the broader field of style-aware language modeling. Fourth, what are the potential applications of the Multi-Style Adapter beyond the datasets used in this paper? How might this approach be used in real-world scenarios requiring style-aware text generation? Exploring the practical applications of the method would further highlight its significance and potential impact. Fifth, what is the motivation for introducing style awareness in language models? While the paper provides some motivation, a more explicit definition of 'style' in the context of language modeling would be beneficial. What specific stylistic features are the authors aiming to capture, and why are existing language models insufficient in this regard? Sixth, how are the style labels obtained for training the style classifier? Is an auxiliary style classifier trained on synthetic data, and if so, what is the training process? A detailed explanation of the style labeling process is crucial for the reproducibility and validity of the proposed method. Seventh, what is the baseline model used for comparison? How is it trained and evaluated? While the paper mentions that the baseline is a standard GPT model, more details on its training procedure would be helpful. Finally, can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the robustness of the proposed method to noisy or adversarial inputs? How does the method perform when presented with inputs that contain errors, inconsistencies, or adversarial perturbations? This is crucial for assessing the practical applicability of the method in real-world scenarios where inputs may not be perfectly clean.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",

The authors propose an enhanced diffusion model that integrates a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to address these challenges. The authors implement a discriminator network to distinguish between real and generated samples, and modify the denoiser to include an adversarial loss term along with the existing reconstruction loss. The authors also introduce a gradient penalty to the adversarial loss to improve training stability. The authors validate the proposed approach through experiments on multiple 2D datasets.\n\n### Soundness\n\n1\n\n### Presentation\n\n1\n\n### Contribution\n\n1\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe authors provide sufficient details in the paper to make it self-contained.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### comment\n\nI don't think this paper is ready for publication, for the following reasons:\n\n1. Novelty: novelty is very limited in this paper. There is a large amount of work injecting GAN into diffusion models. The authors should provide a more comprehensive literature review and position their work against existing works, such as [1] Diffusion-GAN: Integrating GANs for Improved Diffusion Models, [2] GAN-guided Diffusion as Plug-and-Play Priors for Conditional Generation, [3] Diffusion Models Are Fast Adaptive Priors and Sample Conditioned Equilibrium Distributions, [4] Plug-and-Play Diffusion Models, [5] Guided Diffusion as Plug-and-Play Priors for Conditional Generation, [6] Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models, [7] SD-GAN: Combining GANs and Diffusion Models for Enhanced Photorealistic Image Generation, [8] Diffusion Adversarial Networks, [9] Adversarial Diffusion Distillation, [10] A Comprehensive Survey of Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Time Series Imputation, [11] Diffusion models for probabilistic time series imputation, [12] TabDDPM: Modelling Tabular Data with Diffusion Models.\n\n2. Clarity: the authors should improve the clarity of the paper. There are a number of aspects that should be improved. For example, the authors should explain how the discriminator is trained.

The reviewers are not in conflict, but rather emphasize different aspects of the same underlying weaknesses.\n\nThe paper attempts to address the novelty concern by highlighting the focus on 2D data and the introduction of a gradient penalty. However, the lack of comparison with existing GAN-diffusion methods and the potential for these methods to also use gradient penalties weakens this claim. The experimental limitations are clear, as the paper does not demonstrate the method's effectiveness on more complex, real-world datasets.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe criticisms regarding limited novelty due to insufficient literature comparison and insufficient experimental validation on simple datasets are **valid**. The paper needs to significantly improve its literature review by including and comparing against relevant GAN-diffusion hybrid methods. Furthermore, the experimental section needs to be expanded to include evaluations on standard, more complex datasets to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n}\n\nNow, I have successfully verified each review. Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a GAN-enhanced diffusion model, aiming to improve the quality and diversity of generated samples. The authors propose integrating a GAN framework into a diffusion model by incorporating a discriminator network and an adversarial loss term into the denoiser. To enhance training stability, they introduce a gradient penalty. The core idea is to leverage the strengths of both GANs and diffusion models, where the GAN component is intended to provide more direct feedback on sample quality, potentially leading to improved sample fidelity and diversity. The authors evaluate their model on four 2D datasets, comparing its performance against a baseline diffusion model without GAN enhancement. The results, presented through quantitative metrics, suggest that the proposed approach yields improvements in sample quality and diversity compared to the baseline. However, the paper's overall significance is limited by a lack of comprehensive literature review and insufficient experimental validation on complex datasets. While the idea of combining GANs and diffusion models is promising, the paper's current form does not fully demonstrate its potential or place it within the broader context of generative modeling research. The paper's contribution is further weakened by the absence of comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and the lack of qualitative results to support the quantitative findings. The paper, in its current state, provides a preliminary exploration of a potentially valuable approach but requires substantial improvements to establish its novelty and practical significance.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n1.25\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.25\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe paper is presented in a clear and easy-to-follow manner, which facilitates understanding of the proposed method. The authors provide a concise description of their approach, which involves integrating a GAN framework into a diffusion model by adding a discriminator and an adversarial loss term to the denoiser. The inclusion of a gradient penalty to improve training stability is a positive step, as it addresses a common challenge in training GANs. The authors also conduct experiments on four different 2D datasets, which provides a basic evaluation of their model's performance. The quantitative results presented in the paper suggest that the proposed GAN-enhanced diffusion model outperforms a baseline diffusion model in terms of sample quality and diversity. This initial empirical evidence, while limited in scope, indicates the potential of the proposed approach. The paper's structure is logical, with distinct sections for the introduction, method, experiments, and results, which makes it easy to navigate. The authors' attempt to differentiate their work by focusing on 2D datasets and introducing a gradient penalty, while not entirely novel, demonstrates an effort to address specific challenges in generative modeling. The paper's clear articulation of the proposed method and its experimental setup allows for a straightforward understanding of the research process. The inclusion of a baseline diffusion model for comparison is also a positive aspect, as it provides a reference point for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed GAN enhancement. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its clarity, its initial exploration of a promising approach, and its presentation of preliminary empirical results.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nAfter a thorough examination of the paper, I have identified two primary weaknesses that significantly impact its overall contribution and validity. First, the paper suffers from a lack of novelty due to an insufficient literature review and a failure to adequately position its work within the existing landscape of GAN-diffusion hybrid models. The authors acknowledge that integrating GANs with other generative models has been explored in various works, citing Song et al. (2020) and Kotelnikov et al. (2022). However, they fail to cite and discuss several crucial papers that directly address the combination of GANs and diffusion models, such as Diffusion-GAN (Guo et al., 2024), SD-GAN (Wang et al., 2023), and Denoising Diffusion GAN (Nek3al, 2022). This omission is a significant oversight, as these papers explore similar ideas and methodologies. The authors attempt to claim novelty by stating that their work focuses on 2D datasets and introduces a gradient penalty, but these aspects alone do not sufficiently differentiate their work from existing approaches. The lack of a comprehensive literature review and a clear articulation of how the proposed method differs from and improves upon existing GAN-diffusion hybrids undermines the paper's claim to originality. This is a critical weakness, as it fails to establish the paper's contribution to the field and leaves the reader questioning the need for this particular approach. The confidence level in this weakness is high, as it is directly supported by the absence of key citations and a lack of comparative analysis in the paper. Second, the paper's experimental results are insufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors conduct experiments on four simple 2D datasets: Circle, Dino, Line, and Moons. While these datasets may be useful for initial testing, they are not representative of real-world data and do not provide a rigorous evaluation of the model's ability to generate high-quality and diverse samples. The paper lacks experiments on standard image synthesis benchmarks, such as CIFAR-10 or CelebA, which are widely used in the generative modeling community. The absence of these benchmarks makes it difficult to assess the practical applicability of the proposed method and to compare its performance against state-of-the-art generative models. The authors only compare their method against a baseline diffusion model without GAN enhancement, which is not sufficient to establish the superiority of their approach. The lack of qualitative results, such as generated samples, further limits the evaluation of the model's performance. The reliance on simple 2D datasets and the absence of comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks significantly weaken the paper's experimental validation. This is a critical weakness, as it fails to provide convincing evidence of the method's effectiveness and limits the paper's impact. The confidence level in this weakness is high, as it is directly supported by the paper's explicit description of the datasets used and the absence of experiments on standard benchmarks. The combination of these two weaknesses – the lack of novelty and the insufficient experimental validation – significantly undermines the paper's overall contribution and limits its potential impact on the field of generative modeling.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete and actionable improvements. First, the authors must significantly expand their literature review to include a thorough discussion of existing methods that combine GANs and diffusion models. This should involve citing and analyzing papers such as Diffusion-GAN (Guo et al., 2024), SD-GAN (Wang et al., 2023), and Denoising Diffusion GAN (Nek3al, 2022), among others. The authors should clearly articulate how their approach differs from and improves upon these existing methods, focusing on specific architectural choices, loss functions, and training procedures. A detailed comparison of the proposed method with these prior works is essential to establish the novelty and contribution of this paper. The authors should also clarify the specific advantages of their approach, such as any improvements in sample quality, training stability, or computational efficiency. Without a comprehensive literature review and a clear positioning of their work within the existing landscape, the novelty and contribution of this paper remain questionable. Second, the authors must significantly strengthen their experimental evaluation by including experiments on more complex and realistic datasets. The current evaluation on simple 2D datasets is insufficient to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method. The authors should consider using standard image synthesis benchmarks, such as CIFAR-10 or CelebA, which are widely used in the generative modeling community. These datasets would provide a more rigorous evaluation of the model's ability to generate high-quality and diverse samples. Additionally, the authors should compare their method against state-of-the-art generative models on these benchmarks. This would allow for a more objective assessment of the proposed method's performance and its potential for real-world applications. The authors should also include a detailed analysis of the computational cost of their method, including training time and memory requirements, and compare it to other approaches. Furthermore, the authors should include qualitative results, such as generated samples, to visually assess the quality and diversity of the generated data. This would complement the quantitative results and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. Third, the authors should provide a more in-depth analysis of their proposed method. This should include a detailed explanation of how the GAN framework enhances the diffusion model, and a discussion of the limitations of their approach. The authors should also conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of each component of their method, such as the discriminator network and the adversarial loss term. For example, they could evaluate the performance of the model without the discriminator or with different adversarial loss functions. This would provide valuable insights into the inner workings of the proposed method and help to identify potential areas for improvement. Finally, the authors should consider providing a more detailed explanation of the training process, including the specific hyperparameters used and the rationale behind their choices. This would improve the reproducibility of their results and allow other researchers to build upon their work. By addressing these points, the authors can significantly improve the quality and impact of their paper.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nAfter reviewing the paper, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the proposed method and its implications. First, how does the proposed method compare to other similar approaches in terms of quantitative metrics and qualitative results, specifically those outlined in papers like Diffusion-GAN, SD-GAN, and Denoising Diffusion GAN? The paper lacks a direct comparison with these methods, making it difficult to assess the relative performance and advantages of the proposed approach. Second, what is the motivation for conducting experiments only on simple 2D datasets? The paper does not provide a clear justification for this choice, and it raises concerns about the method's ability to scale to more complex, real-world datasets. Can the method scale to more complex, real-world datasets, and what modifications would be necessary to achieve this? Third, what are the specific architectural differences between the proposed GAN-enhanced diffusion model and the existing GAN-diffusion hybrid models? The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the architectural choices, loss functions, and training procedures used in these prior works with the proposed method. A more detailed explanation of these differences is essential to understand the novelty of the proposed approach. Fourth, what is the computational cost of the proposed method, including training time and memory requirements, and how does it compare to other approaches? The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost, which is an important factor in assessing the practical applicability of the method. Fifth, what are the limitations of the proposed method, and what are the potential areas for future research? The paper does not provide a thorough discussion of the limitations of the approach, which is important for understanding its scope and potential for improvement. Finally, what is the sensitivity of the proposed method to hyperparameter settings, and what are the best practices for tuning these parameters? The paper does not provide a detailed explanation of the training process, including the specific hyperparameters used and the rationale behind their choices. Addressing these questions would significantly enhance the paper's clarity and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n4.75\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a GAN-enhanced diffusion model, aiming to improve the quality and diversity of generated samples. The authors propose integrating a GAN framework into a diffusion model by incorporating a discriminator network and an adversarial loss term into the denoiser. To enhance training stability, they introduce a gradient penalty. The core idea is to leverage the strengths of both GANs and diffusion models, where the GAN component is intended to provide more direct feedback on sample quality, potentially leading to improved sample fidelity and diversity. The authors evaluate their model on four 2D datasets, comparing its performance against a baseline diffusion model without GAN enhancement. The results, presented through quantitative metrics, suggest that the proposed approach yields improvements in sample quality and diversity compared to the baseline. However, the paper's overall significance is limited by a lack of comprehensive literature review and insufficient experimental validation on complex datasets. While the idea of combining GANs and diffusion models is promising, the paper's current form does not fully demonstrate its potential or place it within the broader context of generative modeling research. The paper's contribution is further weakened by the absence of comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and the lack of qualitative results to support the quantitative findings. The paper, in its current state, provides a preliminary exploration of a potentially valuable approach but requires substantial improvements to establish its novelty and practical significance.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n1.25\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.25\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe paper is presented in a clear and easy-to-follow manner, which facilitates understanding of the proposed method. The authors provide a concise description of their approach, which involves integrating a GAN framework into a diffusion model by adding a discriminator and an adversarial loss term to the denoiser. The inclusion of a gradient penalty to improve training stability is a positive step, as it addresses a common challenge in training GANs. The authors also conduct experiments on four different 2D datasets, which provides a basic evaluation of their model's performance. The quantitative results presented in the paper suggest that the proposed GAN-enhanced diffusion model outperforms a baseline diffusion model in terms of sample quality and diversity. This initial empirical evidence, while limited in scope, indicates the potential of the proposed approach. The paper's structure is logical, with distinct sections for the introduction, method, experiments, and results, which makes it easy to navigate. The authors' attempt to differentiate their work by focusing on 2D datasets and introducing a gradient penalty, while not entirely novel, demonstrates an effort to address specific challenges in generative modeling. The paper's clear articulation of the proposed method and its experimental setup allows for a straightforward understanding of the research process. The inclusion of a baseline diffusion model for comparison is also a positive aspect, as it provides a reference point for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed GAN enhancement. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its clarity, its initial exploration of a promising approach, and its presentation of preliminary empirical results.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nAfter a thorough examination of the paper, I have identified two primary weaknesses that significantly impact its overall contribution and validity. First, the paper suffers from a lack of novelty due to an insufficient literature review and a failure to adequately position its work within the existing landscape of GAN-diffusion hybrid models. The authors acknowledge that integrating GANs with other generative models has been explored in various works, citing Song et al. (2020) and Kotelnikov et al. (2022). However, they fail to cite and discuss several crucial papers that directly address the combination of GANs and diffusion models, such as Diffusion-GAN (Guo et al., 2024), SD-GAN (Wang et al., 2023), and Denoising Diffusion GAN (Nek3al, 2022). This omission is a significant oversight, as these papers explore similar ideas and methodologies. The authors attempt to claim novelty by stating that their work focuses on 2D datasets and introduces a gradient penalty, but these aspects alone do not sufficiently differentiate their work from existing approaches. The lack of a comprehensive literature review and a clear articulation of how the proposed method differs from and improves upon existing GAN-diffusion hybrids undermines the paper's claim to originality. This is a critical weakness, as it fails to establish the paper's contribution to the field and leaves the reader questioning the need for this particular approach. The confidence level in this weakness is high, as it is directly supported by the absence of key citations and a lack of comparative analysis in the paper. Second, the paper's experimental results are insufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors conduct experiments on four simple 2D datasets: Circle, Dino, Line, and Moons. While these datasets may be useful for initial testing, they are not representative of real-world data and do not provide a rigorous evaluation of the model's ability to generate high-quality and diverse samples. The paper lacks experiments on standard image synthesis benchmarks, such as CIFAR-10 or CelebA, which are widely used in the generative modeling community. The absence of these benchmarks makes it difficult to assess the practical applicability of the proposed method and to compare its performance against state-of-the-art generative models. The authors only compare their method against a baseline diffusion model without GAN enhancement, which is not sufficient to establish the superiority of their approach. The lack of qualitative results, such as generated samples, further limits the evaluation of the model's performance. The reliance on simple 2D datasets and the absence of comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks significantly weaken the paper's experimental validation. This is a critical weakness, as it fails to provide convincing evidence of the method's effectiveness and limits the paper's impact. The confidence level in this weakness is high, as it is directly supported by the paper's explicit description of the datasets used and the absence of experiments on standard benchmarks. The combination of these two weaknesses – the lack of novelty and the insufficient experimental validation – significantly undermines the paper's overall contribution and limits its potential impact on the field of generative modeling.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete and actionable improvements. First, the authors must significantly expand their literature review to include a thorough discussion of existing methods that combine GANs and diffusion models. This should involve citing and analyzing papers such as Diffusion-GAN (Guo et al., 2024), SD-GAN (Wang et al., 2023), and Denoising Diffusion GAN (Nek3al, 2022), among others. The authors should clearly articulate how their approach differs from and improves upon these existing methods, focusing on specific architectural choices, loss functions, and training procedures. A detailed comparison of the proposed method with these prior works is essential to establish the novelty and contribution of this paper. The authors should also clarify the specific advantages of their approach, such as any improvements in sample quality, training stability, or computational efficiency. Without a comprehensive literature review and a clear positioning of their work within the existing landscape, the novelty and contribution of this paper remain questionable. Second, the authors must significantly strengthen their experimental evaluation by including experiments on more complex and realistic datasets.

Finally, the authors should consider providing a more detailed explanation of the training process, including the specific hyperparameters used and the rationale behind their choices. This would improve the reproducibility of their results and allow other researchers to build upon their work. By addressing these points, the authors can significantly improve the quality and impact of their paper.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nAfter reviewing the paper, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the proposed method and its implications. First, how does the proposed method compare to other similar approaches in terms of quantitative metrics and qualitative results, specifically those outlined in papers like Diffusion-GAN, SD-GAN, and Denoising Diffusion GAN? The paper lacks a direct comparison with these methods, making it difficult to assess the relative performance and advantages of the proposed approach. Second, what is the motivation for conducting experiments only on simple 2D datasets? The paper does not provide a clear justification for this choice, and it raises concerns about the method's ability to scale to more complex, real-world datasets. Can the method scale to more complex, real-world datasets, and what modifications would be necessary to achieve this? Third, what are the specific architectural differences between the proposed GAN-enhanced diffusion model and the existing GAN-diffusion hybrid models? The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the architectural choices, loss functions, and training procedures used in these prior works with the proposed method. A more detailed explanation of these differences is essential to understand the novelty of the proposed approach. Fourth, what is the computational cost of the proposed method, including training time and memory requirements, and how does it compare to other approaches? The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost, which is an important factor in assessing the practical applicability of the method. Fifth, what are the limitations of the proposed method, and what are the potential areas for future research? The paper does not provide a thorough discussion of the limitations of the approach, which is important for understanding its scope and potential for improvement. Finally, what is the sensitivity of the proposed method to hyperparameter settings, and what are the best practices for tuning these parameters? The paper does not provide a detailed explanation of the training process, including the specific hyperparameters used and the rationale behind their choices. Addressing these questions would significantly enhance the paper's clarity and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n4.75\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",

The authors should also conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of each component of their method, such as the discriminator network and the adversarial loss term. For example, they could evaluate the performance of the model without the discriminator or with different adversarial loss functions. This would provide valuable insights into the inner workings of the proposed method and help to identify potential areas for improvement. Finally, the authors should consider providing a more detailed explanation of the training process, including the specific hyperparameters used and the rationale behind their choices. This would improve the reproducibility of their results and allow other researchers to build upon their work. By addressing these points, the authors can significantly improve the quality and impact of their paper.",

First, how does the proposed method compare to other similar approaches in terms of quantitative metrics and qualitative results, specifically those outlined in papers like Diffusion-GAN, SD-GAN, and Denoising Diffusion GAN? The paper lacks a direct comparison with these methods, making it difficult to assess the relative performance and advantages of the proposed approach. Second, what is the motivation for conducting experiments only on simple 2D datasets?

The method incorporates a dual architecture that processes the input at a global scale and a local scale. A learnable weighting mechanism balances the contributions of these branches dynamically across denoising timesteps.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n1\n\n### Contribution\n\n1\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The proposed method improves the sample quality of diffusion models in low-dimensional spaces.\n- The paper presents an interesting idea of using dual-scale architecture for diffusion models.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n - The paper is not well-written, with poor presentation of the results.

The paper should provide more quantitative results, such as FID scores, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n- The paper does not compare the proposed method to other existing methods for improving the sample quality of diffusion models.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper needs significant improvements in several areas. First, the presentation of results must be drastically improved. The figures lack proper labels, making it difficult to understand the results being presented. The sample quality is also hard to assess, especially in Figure 3, where the images are too small and lack clear labeling. The authors should provide larger, more clearly labeled figures, and consider using higher-resolution examples to better showcase the method's performance. Additionally, the paper should include more quantitative metrics, such as FID scores, to provide a more objective evaluation of the proposed method. The current reliance on visual inspection is insufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.\n\nSecond, the scope of the experiments is too limited. The paper only presents results on 2D datasets, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method. The authors should evaluate their method on higher-dimensional datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness in more complex scenarios. Furthermore, the paper lacks a strong justification for why the proposed method is specifically needed for low-dimensional diffusion models. It is unclear if the same idea would be effective for higher-dimensional data, and the authors should provide a more thorough discussion of the potential benefits and limitations of their approach in different settings. The paper should also explore the computational cost of the proposed method, as the dual architecture may introduce additional overhead.\n\nFinally, the paper lacks a proper comparison to existing methods. The authors should compare their method to other techniques for improving the sample quality of diffusion models. This would help to establish the novelty and effectiveness of their approach. The paper should also provide a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and potential directions for future research. The current analysis is too brief and does not provide sufficient insight into the behavior of the proposed method.\n\n### Questions\n\n- Why is the proposed method specifically needed for low-dimensional diffusion models? Will the same idea be effective for higher-dimensional data?\n- How does the proposed method compare to other existing methods for improving the sample quality of diffusion models?\n- What is the computational cost of the proposed method compared to other methods?\n\n### Rating\n\n1\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces a novel diffusion model architecture designed specifically for low-dimensional data. The approach incorporates a dual-scale mechanism that processes both the original low-dimensional input (global scale) and an upscaled version (local scale). A learnable weighting mechanism is introduced to dynamically balance the contributions from these two branches across different timesteps. The model is evaluated on four 2D datasets (circle, dino, line, and moons), with KL divergence used as the primary evaluation metric. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves modest improvements over a baseline diffusion model.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n2\n\n### Contribution\n\n1\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The proposed dual-scale mechanism is a novel approach, specifically tailored to address the challenges of low-dimensional generative modeling. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work to explore multi-scale processing in this context.\n- The proposed model demonstrates modest improvements over the baseline diffusion model across the evaluated datasets.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n - The paper's primary contribution is focused on low-dimensional data, which may have limited relevance for the ICLR community, as diffusion models are more commonly applied to high-dimensional data such as images.\n- The evaluation is limited to only four relatively simple 2D datasets, raising concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method to more complex low-dimensional tasks. The datasets used, while common for initial testing, do not represent the complexity or diversity one might expect in real-world low-dimensional data. For example, the 'dino' dataset, while more complex than the others, is still a relatively simple shape. The lack of datasets with higher dimensionality or more intricate structures makes it difficult to assess the method's robustness.\n- The observed improvements over the baseline are modest, and it is unclear if these gains justify the added complexity of the proposed architecture. The reported KL divergence reductions, while statistically significant, are not substantial enough to clearly demonstrate a practical advantage. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with the dual-scale mechanism, making it difficult to assess the trade-off between performance gains and increased resource consumption.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit significantly from a more rigorous evaluation on a wider range of low-dimensional datasets. Specifically, the authors should consider including datasets with higher dimensionality and more complex structures to better assess the generalizability of their approach. For example, datasets derived from real-world applications, such as those found in computational biology or social sciences, could provide a more compelling evaluation. Furthermore, the authors should explore the performance of their method on datasets with varying levels of noise and complexity to understand its limitations and robustness. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's applicability and potential impact.\n\nTo address the concern regarding the modest improvements, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the performance gains. This should include a breakdown of the contributions of the global and local branches, as well as an analysis of the learned weighting mechanism. It would be beneficial to visualize the weighting patterns across different timesteps and datasets to understand how the model adapts to different data characteristics. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough comparison of the computational cost of their method compared to the baseline, including training time and memory usage. This would help to determine if the performance gains justify the added complexity. A more detailed ablation study, beyond just the dual-scale mechanism, could also help to identify the key factors contributing to the observed improvements.\n\nFinally, the authors should consider exploring the potential of their method for higher-dimensional data. While the current focus is on low-dimensional data, the core idea of dual-scale processing could be relevant for higher-dimensional applications. The authors could investigate how their method could be adapted to handle higher-dimensional inputs, potentially by incorporating techniques such as dimensionality reduction or hierarchical processing. This would broaden the appeal of their work and demonstrate the potential for wider impact. Furthermore, the authors should discuss the limitations of their approach and suggest potential avenues for future research, such as exploring different weighting mechanisms or incorporating attention mechanisms to further enhance the model's ability to capture both global and local features.\n\n### Questions\n\n- What are the potential applications of this method beyond the evaluated 2D datasets? Could it be relevant for low-dimensional data in other domains, such as tabular data or time series?\n- How does the computational cost of the proposed method compare to the baseline diffusion model? Is the trade-off between performance and complexity justified?\n- Could the authors provide insights into how the learned weighting mechanism behaves across different datasets and timesteps? Are there any consistent patterns or strategies that emerge?\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 3\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes a dual-branch denoiser for diffusion models, which is conditioned on the timestep. The denoiser consists of two branches, one for the original data and the other for the upsampled data. The outputs of the two branches are combined with a weighting mechanism that is also conditioned on the timestep. The proposed method is evaluated on four 2D datasets and shows improved performance over the baseline model.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n1\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n* The proposed method is simple and effective. It can be easily integrated into existing diffusion models and improves the performance with a slight increase in computation.\n* The evaluation is comprehensive. The authors evaluated the proposed method on multiple datasets and conducted multiple runs to show the stability of the training. They also conducted ablation studies to show the effectiveness of the proposed components.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n * The motivation is unclear. The authors claim that the proposed method is designed for low-dimensional diffusion models. However, I do not see why the proposed method can only be applied to low-dimensional data. Moreover, low-dimensional data is a rare case in the current stage, and I am not sure why we need a special model for it. The authors should provide a more concrete definition of low-dimensional data and justify the need for a specialized model in this context. It is also unclear what specific challenges arise in low-dimensional diffusion models that the proposed method addresses, as opposed to simply being a potentially beneficial modification for any diffusion model.\n* The writing is poor. The paper is not well-organized, and the authors introduce the datasets and the experimental results in the methodology section. I suggest the authors reorganize the paper and put the datasets in a separate section and the results in another section. The lack of clear separation between methodology and results makes it difficult to follow the experimental setup and understand the findings. For example, the description of the datasets is intertwined with the explanation of the method, which disrupts the flow and clarity of the paper.\n* The evaluation is limited. The authors only evaluated the proposed method on 2D datasets, which are much simpler than the 3D images or videos that are commonly used in diffusion models. I suggest the authors evaluate the proposed method on more complex datasets to show its effectiveness. The choice of 2D datasets, while potentially useful for initial testing, does not demonstrate the method's applicability to the complex, high-dimensional data that diffusion models are typically applied to. This limits the impact and generalizability of the findings.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe authors should provide a more rigorous definition of what constitutes 'low-dimensional' data within the context of diffusion models. This definition should be accompanied by a clear explanation of the specific challenges that arise when applying diffusion models to such data. For instance, do low-dimensional datasets exhibit a lack of diversity in the generated samples, or do they suffer from mode collapse more frequently than high-dimensional datasets? The authors should also justify why a specialized model is needed for low-dimensional data, as opposed to simply using a standard diffusion model. This justification should be supported by empirical evidence or theoretical arguments that demonstrate the limitations of existing methods when applied to low-dimensional data. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the scope of their method and explain why it is not limited to low-dimensional data, given that the proposed dual-branch denoiser and timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism could potentially be beneficial for higher-dimensional datasets as well.\n\nTo improve the organization of the paper, the authors should clearly separate the methodology, datasets, and results into distinct sections. The methodology section should focus solely on the proposed method, including the dual-branch denoiser, the upsampling operation, and the timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism. The datasets section should provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments, including their characteristics and any preprocessing steps. The results section should present the experimental findings, including quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations. This separation will enhance the clarity and readability of the paper, making it easier for readers to understand the proposed method and its evaluation. The authors should also ensure that the experimental setup is clearly described, including the training parameters and the evaluation metrics used.\n\nFinally, the authors should expand their evaluation to include more complex datasets, such as those commonly used in diffusion model research. This could include image datasets like CIFAR-10 or CelebA, or even more complex datasets like those used in video generation. Evaluating the proposed method on these datasets would provide a more comprehensive assessment of its effectiveness and generalizability. The authors should also consider comparing their method to other state-of-the-art diffusion models on these datasets to demonstrate its competitive performance. This would strengthen the paper's contribution and make it more relevant to the broader research community. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of their method, including the training time and inference time, and compare it to other methods.\n\n### Questions\n\n* What is the definition of low-dimensional data? How is it different from high-dimensional data? Why do we need a special model for low-dimensional data? Can the proposed method be applied to high-dimensional data?\n* Why did the authors choose the four 2D datasets for the evaluation? How representative are they of the real-world low-dimensional data? How are the four datasets in terms of complexity? Is it possible to evaluate the proposed method on more complex datasets?\n* In Section 4.1, the authors claim that the upscaling operation can help capture fine-grained details. However, I am not sure why upsampling can help capture details. Could the authors provide some explanations? Also, how is the upsampling operation implemented? Is it a learnable transformation or a simple interpolation method?\n* In Section 4.2, the authors use a two-layer MLP for the weighting mechanism. I wonder if it is possible to directly predict the weighting for the two branches with a single linear layer.\n* In Section 6.1, the authors only reported the training time and inference time of the baseline model. I wonder what the training and inference times are for the proposed model. Is it much slower than the baseline model?\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 4\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes an adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for low-dimensional diffusion models. The method uses two parallel branches: a global branch for the original input and a local branch for an upscaled version, with a learnable weighting mechanism that adjusts their contributions based on the timestep. The approach is evaluated on four 2D datasets (circle, dino, line, and moons), showing improvements in sample quality and reductions in KL divergence compared to a baseline model.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n2\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The paper introduces a novel dual-scale architecture that addresses the challenge of balancing global structure and local details in low-dimensional diffusion models.\n- The learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism is an innovative approach that allows the model to dynamically adjust its focus during the denoising process.\n- The paper provides a clear explanation of the method, including the architecture, training process, and the rationale behind the dual-scale approach.\n- The evaluation on multiple datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving sample quality and reducing KL divergence.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n - The paper lacks a thorough theoretical analysis of why the dual-scale approach works, particularly in low-dimensional spaces. A deeper understanding of the interplay between global and local features would strengthen the paper.\n- The experiments are limited to 2D datasets, which may not fully demonstrate the method's potential in higher-dimensional applications. It would be beneficial to see how the approach scales to more complex data.\n- The computational cost of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, which might be a concern for practical applications. A more detailed analysis of the trade-off between performance and computational cost is needed.\n- The paper does not provide a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for low-dimensional diffusion models, making it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed approach.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit significantly from a more in-depth theoretical exploration of the dual-scale approach. While the empirical results are promising, a theoretical framework explaining why processing both global and local features simultaneously improves performance in low-dimensional spaces is crucial. This could involve analyzing the spectral properties of the data and how the dual-scale architecture interacts with them, or perhaps a study of the information flow within the network. For example, the authors could investigate whether the global branch captures low-frequency components of the data distribution, while the local branch focuses on high-frequency details, and how the adaptive weighting mechanism facilitates this division of labor. Such an analysis would provide a stronger foundation for the proposed method and guide future research in this area.\n\nFurthermore, the experimental evaluation should be expanded to include more complex, higher-dimensional datasets. While the 2D datasets provide a good starting point, they do not fully capture the challenges of real-world applications. The authors should consider evaluating their method on datasets with more intricate structures and higher dimensionality, such as those found in image or audio processing. This would not only demonstrate the scalability of the approach but also reveal potential limitations that might not be apparent in low-dimensional settings. For instance, it would be valuable to see how the method performs on datasets with varying levels of complexity and how the adaptive weighting mechanism behaves in these scenarios. Additionally, a more detailed analysis of the computational cost is needed, including a breakdown of the time spent in each branch of the network and how this scales with increasing dimensionality. This would help to identify potential bottlenecks and guide the development of more efficient implementations.\n\nFinally, a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for low-dimensional diffusion models is essential to properly contextualize the performance of the proposed approach. The authors should include a comparison with relevant baselines, such as other adaptive diffusion models or methods that explicitly address the balance between global and local features. This comparison should not only focus on quantitative metrics like KL divergence but also on qualitative aspects of the generated samples. A thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method compared to existing approaches would provide a more complete picture of its contributions and limitations. This would also help to identify areas where the proposed method excels and where further improvements are needed.\n\n### Questions\n\n- How does the proposed method perform on higher-dimensional datasets? Are there any scalability issues?\n- Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost, including a breakdown of the time spent in each branch of the network?\n- How does the method compare to other state-of-the-art approaches for low-dimensional diffusion models in terms of both performance and computational efficiency?\n\n### Rating\n\n5\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********\n\n}\n\nI have finished generating simulated reviews from 4 reviewers.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces an adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for diffusion models, specifically targeting the challenges associated with low-dimensional data. The core idea revolves around a dual-branch architecture, where one branch processes the original low-dimensional input, capturing the global structure, while the other branch processes an upscaled version of the input, aiming to capture fine-grained local details. A key innovation is the introduction of a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism that dynamically balances the contributions of these two branches during the denoising process. This mechanism allows the model to adaptively focus on either global or local features depending on the current stage of denoising and the specific characteristics of the data. The authors evaluate their proposed method on four 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons, using KL divergence as the primary metric. The results indicate that the proposed dual-scale approach achieves modest improvements in sample quality compared to a baseline single-scale diffusion model. The authors also acknowledge that the proposed method has a higher computational cost than the baseline. The paper's contribution lies in the novel application of a dual-scale mechanism to low-dimensional diffusion models, addressing the challenge of balancing global and local feature representation. While the empirical results show some improvement over a baseline, the paper's focus on low-dimensional data and the limited scope of the experiments raise questions about the broader applicability and significance of the proposed method. The lack of a strong theoretical foundation and the absence of comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods for low-dimensional diffusion models further limit the impact of the work. Overall, the paper presents an interesting approach to a specific problem, but its practical significance and generalizability remain unclear.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe primary strength of this paper lies in its introduction of a novel dual-scale architecture tailored for low-dimensional diffusion models. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work to explore multi-scale processing in this specific context. The idea of using a dual-branch approach, with one branch processing the original input and the other an upscaled version, is a creative way to address the challenge of capturing both global structure and local details in low-dimensional data. The adaptive weighting mechanism, which dynamically balances the contributions of the two branches based on the timestep, is another innovative aspect of the proposed method. This mechanism allows the model to flexibly adjust its focus during the denoising process, potentially leading to improved sample quality. The paper also provides a clear explanation of the proposed method, including the architecture, training process, and the rationale behind the dual-scale approach. The experimental setup is well-defined, and the authors conduct multiple runs to demonstrate the stability of the training. The inclusion of ablation studies, comparing the proposed method with a baseline model and variations of the proposed method, further strengthens the empirical evaluation. The paper demonstrates modest improvements in sample quality, as measured by KL divergence, compared to a baseline single-scale diffusion model. While the improvements are not substantial, they do indicate the potential of the proposed approach. The paper also acknowledges the increased computational cost of the proposed method, which is a transparent and honest assessment of the trade-offs involved. Overall, the paper presents a novel and well-executed approach to a specific problem in diffusion modeling, and the innovative use of a dual-scale architecture and adaptive weighting mechanism are noteworthy contributions.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nAfter a thorough examination of the paper, I've identified several key weaknesses that significantly impact its overall contribution. First, the paper lacks a robust theoretical analysis of why the proposed dual-scale approach is effective, particularly in low-dimensional spaces. While the authors introduce the architecture and adaptive weighting mechanism, they do not provide a formal theoretical justification for why this specific combination works. The motivation section describes the problem of balancing global and local features, but it doesn't offer a theoretical framework to support the proposed solution. The method section focuses on the architecture and mechanism but lacks theoretical derivations or proofs. This absence of theoretical grounding weakens the paper's contribution by not providing a deeper understanding of the method's effectiveness. Second, the experimental evaluation is limited to only four relatively simple 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. This narrow scope raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method to more complex low-dimensional tasks. The datasets used, while common for initial testing, do not represent the complexity or diversity one might expect in real-world low-dimensional data. The lack of experiments on higher-dimensional datasets also limits the assessment of the method's potential for broader applications. The paper acknowledges the success of diffusion models in high-dimensional spaces in the introduction, but the experiments do not explore this. Third, the paper does not provide a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for low-dimensional diffusion models. The experiments section compares the proposed method against a baseline single-scale diffusion model and variations of the proposed method, but it does not include comparisons with other established methods for improving diffusion model sample quality or methods specifically designed for low-dimensional data. This lack of comparison makes it difficult to assess the relative performance and advantages of the proposed approach. The related work section mentions TabDDPM as a related work on low-dimensional diffusion models, but it is not included as a baseline in the experimental comparison. Fourth, the paper does not provide a strong justification for why the proposed method is specifically needed for low-dimensional diffusion models. While the authors highlight the challenges of balancing global and local features in low-dimensional spaces, it is not clear if the same idea would be effective for higher-dimensional data. The paper does not provide a concrete definition of \"low-dimensional data\" and does not thoroughly explore the potential benefits and limitations of the approach in different settings. The paper also lacks a detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with the dual-scale mechanism. While the paper acknowledges that the proposed method has a higher computational cost than the baseline, it does not provide a detailed breakdown of where this increase comes from or a thorough analysis of the trade-off between performance gains and increased resource consumption. Finally, the paper relies primarily on KL divergence as a quantitative metric, and it does not include other common metrics such as FID scores. This lack of diverse quantitative metrics weakens the evaluation of the proposed method. The observed improvements over the baseline are modest, and it is unclear if these gains justify the added complexity of the proposed architecture. The reported KL divergence reductions, while statistically significant, are not substantial enough to clearly demonstrate a practical advantage. These limitations, which I have verified through a close reading of the paper, significantly impact the overall contribution and generalizability of the work. I have a high level of confidence in these identified weaknesses, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and the absence of certain key elements.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should conduct a more in-depth theoretical analysis of the dual-scale approach. This analysis should explore why processing both global and local features simultaneously improves performance in low-dimensional spaces. This could involve analyzing the spectral properties of the data and how the dual-scale architecture interacts with them, or perhaps a study of the information flow within the network. For example, the authors could investigate whether the global branch captures low-frequency components of the data distribution, while the local branch focuses on high-frequency details, and how the adaptive weighting mechanism facilitates this division of labor. Such an analysis would provide a stronger foundation for the proposed method and guide future research in this area. Second, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include more complex, higher-dimensional datasets. While the 2D datasets provide a good starting point, they do not fully capture the challenges of real-world applications. The authors should consider evaluating their method on datasets with more intricate structures and higher dimensionality, such as those found in image or audio processing. This would not only demonstrate the scalability of the approach but also reveal potential limitations that might not be apparent in low-dimensional settings. For instance, it would be valuable to see how the method performs on datasets with varying levels of complexity and how the adaptive weighting mechanism behaves in these scenarios. Third, the authors should include a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for low-dimensional diffusion models. This comparison should not only focus on quantitative metrics like KL divergence but also on qualitative aspects of the generated samples. The authors should compare their method to relevant baselines, such as other adaptive diffusion models or methods that explicitly address the balance between global and local features. This comparison should also include a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method compared to existing approaches. Fourth, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of their method, including a breakdown of the time spent in each branch of the network and how this scales with increasing dimensionality. This would help to identify potential bottlenecks and guide the development of more efficient implementations. The authors should also explore potential optimizations to reduce the computational overhead of the proposed method. Fifth, the authors should include more diverse quantitative metrics, such as FID scores, to provide a more objective evaluation of the proposed method. The current reliance on KL divergence is insufficient to fully assess the performance of the method. Finally, the authors should provide a more detailed justification for why the proposed method is specifically needed for low-dimensional diffusion models. They should discuss the potential benefits and limitations of their approach in different settings and explore the possibility of applying the method to higher-dimensional data. The authors should also provide a more concrete definition of \"low-dimensional data\" and discuss its characteristics in the context of diffusion models. These suggestions, which are directly linked to the identified weaknesses, would significantly strengthen the paper and enhance its overall contribution.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nAfter reviewing the paper, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the proposed method and its implications. First, what is the specific definition of \"low-dimensional data\" that the authors are using, and how does it differ from high-dimensional data in the context of diffusion models? What are the unique challenges that arise when applying diffusion models to low-dimensional data, and how does the proposed method specifically address these challenges? Second, what is the rationale behind using a learnable linear transformation for the upscaling operation in the local branch? Why is this approach preferred over other upsampling techniques, and how does it contribute to capturing fine-grained details? Third, how does the proposed method perform on higher-dimensional datasets? Are there any scalability issues that arise when applying the method to more complex data? What are the limitations of the proposed method in terms of its applicability to different types of data? Fourth, can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, including a breakdown of the time spent in each branch of the network? How does the computational cost scale with increasing dimensionality, and what are the potential bottlenecks? Fifth, how does the learned weighting mechanism behave across different datasets and timesteps? Are there any consistent patterns or strategies that emerge? How does the weighting mechanism adapt to different data characteristics, and what is the impact of this adaptation on the denoising process? Sixth, what are the potential applications of this method beyond the evaluated 2D datasets? Could it be relevant for low-dimensional data in other domains, such as tabular data or time series? What are the limitations of the proposed method in terms of its applicability to different types of data? Finally, why did the authors choose the four specific 2D datasets for the evaluation? How representative are they of real-world low-dimensional data? How are these datasets in terms of complexity, and what are the potential limitations of using these datasets for evaluation? These questions, which target core methodological choices and key assumptions, are essential for a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method and its potential impact.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

The datasets used, while common for initial testing, do not represent the complexity or diversity one might expect in real-world low-dimensional data. For example, the 'dino' dataset, while more complex than the others, is still a relatively simple shape. The lack of datasets with higher dimensionality or more intricate structures makes it difficult to assess the method's robustness.\n- The observed improvements over the baseline are modest, and it is unclear if these gains justify the added complexity of the proposed architecture. The reported KL divergence reductions, while statistically significant, are not substantial enough to clearly demonstrate a practical advantage. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with the dual-scale mechanism, making it difficult to assess the trade-off between performance gains and increased resource consumption.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit significantly from a more rigorous evaluation on a wider range of low-dimensional datasets. Specifically, the authors should consider including datasets with higher dimensionality and more complex structures to better assess the generalizability of their approach. For example, datasets derived from real-world applications, such as those found in computational biology or social sciences, could provide a more compelling evaluation. Furthermore, the authors should explore the performance of their method on datasets with varying levels of noise and complexity to understand its limitations and robustness. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's applicability and potential impact.\n\nTo address the concern regarding the modest improvements, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the performance gains. This should include a breakdown of the contributions of the global and local branches, as well as an analysis of the learned weighting mechanism. It would be beneficial to visualize the weighting patterns across different timesteps and datasets to understand how the model adapts to different data characteristics. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough comparison of the computational cost of their method compared to the baseline, including training time and memory usage. This would help to determine if the performance gains justify the added complexity. A more detailed ablation study, beyond just the dual-scale mechanism, could also help to identify the key factors contributing to the observed improvements.\n\nFinally, the authors should consider exploring the potential of their method for higher-dimensional data. While the current focus is on low-dimensional data, the core idea of dual-scale processing could be relevant for higher-dimensional applications. The authors could investigate how their method could be adapted to handle higher-dimensional inputs, potentially by incorporating techniques such as dimensionality reduction or hierarchical processing. This would broaden the appeal of their work and demonstrate the potential for wider impact. Furthermore, the authors should discuss the limitations of their approach and suggest potential avenues for future research, such as exploring different weighting mechanisms or incorporating attention mechanisms to further enhance the model's ability to capture both global and local features.\n\n### Questions\n\n- What are the potential applications of this method beyond the evaluated 2D datasets? Could it be relevant for low-dimensional data in other domains, such as tabular data or time series?\n- How does the computational cost of the proposed method compare to the baseline diffusion model? Is the trade-off between performance and complexity justified?\n- Could the authors provide insights into how the learned weighting mechanism behaves across different datasets and timesteps?

                    "text": "### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes a dual-branch denoiser for diffusion models, which is conditioned on the timestep. The denoiser consists of two branches, one for the original data and the other for the upsampled data. The outputs of the two branches are combined with a weighting mechanism that is also conditioned on the timestep. The proposed method is evaluated on four 2D datasets and shows improved performance over the baseline model.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n1\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n* The proposed method is simple and effective. It can be easily integrated into existing diffusion models and improves the performance with a slight increase in computation.\n* The evaluation is comprehensive. The authors evaluated the proposed method on multiple datasets and conducted multiple runs to show the stability of the training. They also conducted ablation studies to show the effectiveness of the proposed components.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n * The motivation is unclear. The authors claim that the proposed method is designed for low-dimensional diffusion models. However, I do not see why the proposed method can only be applied to low-dimensional data. Moreover, low-dimensional data is a rare case in the current stage, and I am not sure why we need a special model for it. The authors should provide a more concrete definition of low-dimensional data and justify the need for a specialized model in this context. It is also unclear what specific challenges arise in low-dimensional diffusion models that the proposed method addresses, as opposed to simply being a potentially beneficial modification for any diffusion model.\n* The writing is poor. The paper is not well-organized, and the authors introduce the datasets and the experimental results in the methodology section. I suggest the authors reorganize the paper and put the datasets in a separate section and the results in another section. The lack of clear separation between methodology and results makes it difficult to follow the experimental setup and understand the findings. For example, the description of the datasets is intertwined with the explanation of the method, which disrupts the flow and clarity of the paper.\n* The evaluation is limited. The authors only evaluated the proposed method on 2D datasets, which are much simpler than the 3D images or videos that are commonly used in diffusion models. I suggest the authors evaluate the proposed method on more complex datasets to show its effectiveness. The choice of 2D datasets, while potentially useful for initial testing, does not demonstrate the method's applicability to the complex, high-dimensional data that diffusion models are typically applied to. This limits the impact and generalizability of the findings.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe authors should provide a more rigorous definition of what constitutes 'low-dimensional' data within the context of diffusion models. This definition should be accompanied by a clear explanation of the specific challenges that arise when applying diffusion models to such data. For instance, do low-dimensional datasets exhibit a lack of diversity in the generated samples, or do they suffer from mode collapse more frequently than high-dimensional datasets? The authors should also justify why a specialized model is needed for low-dimensional data, as opposed to simply using a standard diffusion model. This justification should be supported by empirical evidence or theoretical arguments that demonstrate the limitations of existing methods when applied to low-dimensional data. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the scope of their method and explain why it is not limited to low-dimensional data, given that the proposed dual-branch denoiser and timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism could potentially be beneficial for higher-dimensional datasets as well.\n\nTo improve the organization of the paper, the authors should clearly separate the methodology, datasets, and results into distinct sections. The methodology section should focus solely on the proposed method, including the dual-branch denoiser, the upsampling operation, and the timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism. The datasets section should provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments, including their characteristics and any preprocessing steps. The results section should present the experimental findings, including quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations. This separation will enhance the clarity and readability of the paper, making it easier for readers to understand the proposed method and its evaluation. The authors should also ensure that the experimental setup is clearly described, including the training parameters and the evaluation metrics used.\n\nFinally, the authors should expand their evaluation to include more complex datasets, such as those commonly used in diffusion model research. This could include image datasets like CIFAR-10 or CelebA, or even more complex datasets like those used in video generation. Evaluating the proposed method on these datasets would provide a more comprehensive assessment of its effectiveness and generalizability. The authors should also consider comparing their method to other state-of-the-art diffusion models on these datasets to demonstrate its competitive performance. This would strengthen the paper's contribution and make it more relevant to the broader research community. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of their method, including the training time and inference time, and compare it to other methods.\n\n### Questions\n\n* What is the definition of low-dimensional data? How is it different from high-dimensional data? Why do we need a special model for low-dimensional data? Can the proposed method be applied to high-dimensional data?\n* Why did the authors choose the four 2D datasets for the evaluation? How representative are they of the real-world low-dimensional data? How are the four datasets in terms of complexity? Is it possible to evaluate the proposed method on more complex datasets?\n* In Section 4.1, the authors claim that the upscaling operation can help capture fine-grained details. However, I am not sure why upsampling can help capture details. Could the authors provide some explanations? Also, how is the upsampling operation implemented? Is it a learnable transformation or a simple interpolation method?\n* In Section 4.2, the authors use a two-layer MLP for the weighting mechanism. I wonder if it is possible to directly predict the weighting for the two branches with a single linear layer.\n* In Section 6.1, the authors only reported the training time and inference time of the baseline model. I wonder what the training and inference times are for the proposed model. Is it much slower than the baseline model?\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********"

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces an adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for diffusion models, specifically targeting the challenges associated with low-dimensional data. The core idea revolves around a dual-branch architecture, where one branch processes the original low-dimensional input, capturing the global structure, while the other branch processes an upscaled version of the input, aiming to capture fine-grained local details. A key innovation is the introduction of a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism that dynamically balances the contributions of these two branches during the denoising process. This mechanism allows the model to adaptively focus on either global or local features depending on the current stage of denoising and the specific characteristics of the data. The authors evaluate their proposed method on four 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons, using KL divergence as the primary metric. The results indicate that the proposed dual-scale approach achieves modest improvements in sample quality compared to a baseline single-scale diffusion model. The authors also acknowledge that the proposed method has a higher computational cost than the baseline. The paper's contribution lies in the novel application of a dual-scale mechanism to low-dimensional diffusion models, addressing the challenge of balancing global and local feature representation. While the empirical results show some improvement over a baseline, the paper's focus on low-dimensional data and the limited scope of the experiments raise questions about the broader applicability and significance of the proposed method. The lack of a strong theoretical foundation and the absence of comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods for low-dimensional diffusion models further limit the impact of the work. Overall, the paper presents an interesting approach to a specific problem, but its practical significance and generalizability remain unclear.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe primary strength of this paper lies in its introduction of a novel dual-scale architecture tailored for low-dimensional diffusion models. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work to explore multi-scale processing in this specific context. The idea of using a dual-branch approach, with one branch processing the original input and the other an upscaled version, is a creative way to address the challenge of capturing both global structure and local details in low-dimensional data. The adaptive weighting mechanism, which dynamically balances the contributions of the two branches based on the timestep, is another innovative aspect of the proposed method.

Overall, the paper presents a novel and well-executed approach to a specific problem in diffusion modeling, and the innovative use of a dual-scale architecture and adaptive weighting mechanism are noteworthy contributions.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nAfter a thorough examination of the paper, I've identified several key weaknesses that significantly impact its overall contribution. First, the paper lacks a robust theoretical analysis of why the proposed dual-scale approach is effective, particularly in low-dimensional spaces. While the authors introduce the architecture and adaptive weighting mechanism, they do not provide a formal theoretical justification for why this specific combination works. The motivation section describes the problem of balancing global and local features, but it doesn't offer a theoretical framework to support the proposed solution. The method section focuses on the architecture and mechanism but lacks theoretical derivations or proofs. This absence of theoretical grounding weakens the paper's contribution by not providing a deeper understanding of the method's effectiveness. Second, the experimental evaluation is limited to only four relatively simple 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. This narrow scope raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method to more complex low-dimensional tasks. The datasets used, while common for initial testing, do not represent the complexity or diversity one might expect in real-world low-dimensional data. The lack of experiments on higher-dimensional datasets also limits the assessment of the method's potential for broader applications. The paper acknowledges the success of diffusion models in high-dimensional spaces in the introduction, but the experiments do not explore this. Third, the paper does not provide a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for low-dimensional diffusion models. The experiments section compares the proposed method against a baseline single-scale diffusion model and variations of the proposed method, but it does not include comparisons with other established methods for improving diffusion model sample quality or methods specifically designed for low-dimensional data. This lack of comparison makes it difficult to assess the relative performance and advantages of the proposed approach. The related work section mentions TabDDPM as a related work on low-dimensional diffusion models, but it is not included as a baseline in the experimental comparison. Fourth, the paper does not provide a strong justification for why the proposed method is specifically needed for low-dimensional diffusion models. While the authors highlight the challenges of balancing global and local features in low-dimensional spaces, it is not clear if the same idea would be effective for higher-dimensional data. The paper does not provide a concrete definition of \"low-dimensional data\" and does not thoroughly explore the potential benefits and limitations of the approach in different settings. The paper also lacks a detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with the dual-scale mechanism. While the paper acknowledges that the proposed method has a higher computational cost than the baseline, it does not provide a detailed breakdown of where this increase comes from or a thorough analysis of the trade-off between performance gains and increased resource consumption. Finally, the paper relies primarily on KL divergence as a quantitative metric, and it does not include other common metrics such as FID scores. This lack of diverse quantitative metrics weakens the evaluation of the proposed method. The observed improvements over the baseline are modest, and it is unclear if these gains justify the added complexity of the proposed architecture. The reported KL divergence reductions, while statistically significant, are not substantial enough to clearly demonstrate a practical advantage. These limitations, which I have verified through a close reading of the paper, significantly impact the overall contribution and generalizability of the work. I have a high level of confidence in these identified weaknesses, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and the absence of certain key elements.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should conduct a more in-depth theoretical analysis of the dual-scale approach. This analysis should explore why processing both global and local features simultaneously improves performance in low-dimensional spaces.

This would help to identify potential bottlenecks and guide the development of more efficient implementations. The authors should also explore potential optimizations to reduce the computational overhead of the proposed method. Fifth, the authors should include more diverse quantitative metrics, such as FID scores, to provide a more objective evaluation of the proposed method. The current reliance on KL divergence is insufficient to fully assess the performance of the method. Finally, the authors should provide a more detailed justification for why the proposed method is specifically needed for low-dimensional diffusion models. They should discuss the potential benefits and limitations of their approach in different settings and explore the possibility of applying the method to higher-dimensional data. The authors should also provide a more concrete definition of \"low-dimensional data\" and discuss its characteristics in the context of diffusion models. These suggestions, which are directly linked to the identified weaknesses, would significantly strengthen the paper and enhance its overall contribution.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nAfter reviewing the paper, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the proposed method and its implications. First, what is the specific definition of \"low-dimensional data\" that the authors are using, and how does it differ from high-dimensional data in the context of diffusion models? What are the unique challenges that arise when applying diffusion models to low-dimensional data, and how does the proposed method specifically address these challenges? Second, what is the rationale behind using a learnable linear transformation for the upscaling operation in the local branch? Why is this approach preferred over other upsampling techniques, and how does it contribute to capturing fine-grained details? Third, how does the proposed method perform on higher-dimensional datasets? Are there any scalability issues that arise when applying the method to more complex data? What are the limitations of the proposed method in terms of its applicability to different types of data? Fourth, can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, including a breakdown of the time spent in each branch of the network? How does the computational cost scale with increasing dimensionality, and what are the potential bottlenecks? Fifth, how does the learned weighting mechanism behave across different datasets and timesteps? Are there any consistent patterns or strategies that emerge? How does the weighting mechanism adapt to different data characteristics, and what is the impact of this adaptation on the denoising process? Sixth, what are the potential applications of this method beyond the evaluated 2D datasets? Could it be relevant for low-dimensional data in other domains, such as tabular data or time series? What are the limitations of the proposed method in terms of its applicability to different types of data? Finally, why did the authors choose the four specific 2D datasets for the evaluation? How representative are they of real-world low-dimensional data? How are these datasets in terms of complexity, and what are the potential limitations of using these datasets for evaluation? These questions, which target core methodological choices and key assumptions, are essential for a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method and its potential impact.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",

This analysis should explore why processing both global and local features simultaneously improves performance in low-dimensional spaces. This could involve analyzing the spectral properties of the data and how the dual-scale architecture interacts with them, or perhaps a study of the information flow within the network. For example, the authors could investigate whether the global branch captures low-frequency components of the data distribution, while the local branch focuses on high-frequency details, and how the adaptive weighting mechanism facilitates this division of labor. Such an analysis would provide a stronger foundation for the proposed method and guide future research in this area. Second, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include more complex, higher-dimensional datasets. While the 2D datasets provide a good starting point, they do not fully capture the challenges of real-world applications. The authors should consider evaluating their method on datasets with more intricate structures and higher dimensionality, such as those found in image or audio processing. This would not only demonstrate the scalability of the approach but also reveal potential limitations that might not be apparent in low-dimensional settings. For instance, it would be valuable to see how the method performs on datasets with varying levels of complexity and how the adaptive weighting mechanism behaves in these scenarios. Third, the authors should include a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for low-dimensional diffusion models. This comparison should not only focus on quantitative metrics like KL divergence but also on qualitative aspects of the generated samples. The authors should compare their method to relevant baselines, such as other adaptive diffusion models or methods that explicitly address the balance between global and local features. This comparison should also include a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method compared to existing approaches. Fourth, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of their method, including a breakdown of the time spent in each branch of the network and how this scales with increasing dimensionality. This would help to identify potential bottlenecks and guide the development of more efficient implementations. The authors should also explore potential optimizations to reduce the computational overhead of the proposed method. Fifth, the authors should include more diverse quantitative metrics, such as FID scores, to provide a more objective evaluation of the proposed method. The current reliance on KL divergence is insufficient to fully assess the performance of the method. Finally, the authors should provide a more detailed justification for why the proposed method is specifically needed for low-dimensional diffusion models. They should discuss the potential benefits and limitations of their approach in different settings and explore the possibility of applying the method to higher-dimensional data. The authors should also provide a more concrete definition of \"low-dimensional data\" and discuss its characteristics in the context of diffusion models. These suggestions, which are directly linked to the identified weaknesses, would significantly strengthen the paper and enhance its overall contribution.",
                "questions": "After reviewing the paper, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the proposed method and its implications. First, what is the specific definition of \"low-dimensional data\" that the authors are using, and how does it differ from high-dimensional data in the context of diffusion models? What are the unique challenges that arise when applying diffusion models to low-dimensional data, and how does the proposed method specifically address these challenges? Second, what is the rationale behind using a learnable linear transformation for the upscaling operation in the local branch? Why is this approach preferred over other upsampling techniques, and how does it contribute to capturing fine-grained details? Third, how does the proposed method perform on higher-dimensional datasets? Are there any scalability issues that arise when applying the method to more complex data? What are the limitations of the proposed method in terms of its applicability to different types of data? Fourth, can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, including a breakdown of the time spent in each branch of the network? How does the computational cost scale with increasing dimensionality, and what are the potential bottlenecks? Fifth, how does the learned weighting mechanism behave across different datasets and timesteps? Are there any consistent patterns or strategies that emerge? How does the weighting mechanism adapt to different data characteristics, and what is the impact of this adaptation on the denoising process? Sixth, what are the potential applications of this method beyond the evaluated 2D datasets? Could it be relevant for low-dimensional data in other domains, such as tabular data or time series? What are the limitations of the proposed method in terms of its applicability to different types of data? Finally, why did the authors choose the four specific 2D datasets for the evaluation? How representative are they of real-world low-dimensional data? How are these datasets in terms of complexity, and what are the potential limitations of using these datasets for evaluation? These questions, which target core methodological choices and key assumptions, are essential for a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method and its potential impact."
