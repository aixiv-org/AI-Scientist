The authors proposed two data-augmentation techniques: (1) operand reversal, i.e., swapping the order of operands for addition; (2) operand negation, i.e., negating one or both of the operands. Experiments show that with data augmentation, the models can achieve 99% validation accuracy in fewer training steps.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n3\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. This paper is clearly written and easy to understand.\n2. The proposed data-augmentation method is effective in accelerating grokking as shown in the experiments.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The proposed data-augmentation method is specifically designed for modular arithmetic. It is not clear if it can be generalized to other types of mathematical problems.\n2. The authors only conducted experiments with a specific transformer-based model. It is not clear if the proposed method is effective on other model architectures.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe primary weakness of this paper lies in the limited scope of the proposed data augmentation techniques. While the results demonstrate effectiveness within modular arithmetic, the lack of exploration into other mathematical domains significantly restricts the impact and generalizability of the findings. For instance, the operand reversal technique, which swaps the order of operands, is specifically tailored to the commutative property of addition and does not have a clear application in non-commutative operations such as matrix multiplication or function composition. Similarly, operand negation, while useful in modular arithmetic, may not be directly applicable to problems involving complex numbers or abstract algebraic structures. To strengthen the paper, the authors should investigate the applicability of their methods to a broader range of mathematical problems, potentially by identifying common properties or structures that allow for similar augmentation strategies. This could involve exploring problems with varying degrees of commutativity, different number systems, or operations with multiple inputs. \n\nFurthermore, the paper's reliance on a single transformer-based model raises concerns about the method's robustness and general applicability. While transformers have shown success in various tasks, it is crucial to demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation is not overly tailored to this specific architecture. Different model architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs), may exhibit different learning dynamics and sensitivities to data augmentation. For example, RNNs, which process sequences iteratively, might benefit from different types of augmentations compared to the parallel processing nature of transformers. Similarly, GNNs, which operate on graph structures, may require augmentations that preserve the underlying graph topology. Therefore, the authors should conduct experiments with a diverse set of model architectures to establish the method's effectiveness across different learning paradigms. This would not only strengthen the paper's claims but also provide valuable insights into the interplay between data augmentation and model architecture.\n\nFinally, the paper would benefit from a more detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the observed acceleration of grokking. While the experiments demonstrate that data augmentation leads to faster generalization, the paper lacks a deeper investigation into why this occurs. For example, it would be beneficial to analyze the learned representations of the models trained with and without data augmentation, to understand how the augmentations affect the model's ability to capture the underlying mathematical structures. Furthermore, the authors could explore the impact of different augmentation probabilities and combinations on the grokking phenomenon. A more thorough analysis of these aspects would provide a deeper understanding of the proposed method and its potential for broader applications.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Can the proposed data-augmentation method be applied to other mathematical problems?\n2. Are there any experimental results of other model architectures, e.g. [1,2,3]?\n3. Can the authors provide some insights or hypothesis about why data augmentation can accelerate grokking?\n\n[1] Alex Damian, Eric Nguyen, David Bau, and Tom Goldstein.

The authors propose a novel data augmentation strategy combining operand reversal and negation, applied with varying probabilities to different operations (addition, subtraction, and division). They use a transformer-based model and conduct experiments across five conditions: no augmentation (baseline), reversal augmentation, negation augmentation, and two levels of combined augmentation (15% and 30% probability each). The results show that targeted data augmentation can significantly accelerate grokking, reducing the steps to reach 99% validation accuracy by up to 76% for addition, 72% for subtraction, and 66% for division. The authors conclude that different augmentation strategies have varying effects across operations, with combined augmentation at 15% probability providing the best overall performance.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3\n\n### Presentation\n\n3\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n\n2. The paper investigates an interesting and important problem, the grokking phenomenon.\n\n3. The proposed augmentation methods seem to be useful to accelerate grokking.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The contribution of this paper is limited. The paper mainly studies the grokking phenomenon in mathematical operations, focusing on modular arithmetic. Although the authors provide some insights into the varying effects of different augmentation strategies on grokking dynamics for different operations, the overall contribution to the field is incremental rather than groundbreaking. The core idea of using data augmentation to improve generalization is not novel, and the specific augmentations (reversal and negation) are relatively simple. The paper lacks a deeper theoretical analysis of why these augmentations lead to faster grokking, and it does not explore more complex or less intuitive augmentation strategies.\n\n2. The novelty of the proposed augmentation methods is questionable. The two proposed methods, operand reversal and negation, are common techniques in data preprocessing and augmentation. While the authors apply these techniques to the specific problem of grokking in modular arithmetic, the methods themselves are not new. The paper does not adequately justify why these particular augmentations are expected to be effective for this problem, beyond the intuitive notion that they increase the diversity of the training data. A more rigorous justification, perhaps based on the symmetries or invariances of the underlying mathematical operations, would be beneficial.\n\n3. The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of related work. While the authors mention the original grokking paper, they do not adequately discuss other relevant work on data augmentation techniques for improving generalization in machine learning, particularly in the context of mathematical reasoning or symbolic manipulation. A more thorough literature review would help to contextualize the paper's contribution and highlight its unique aspects (if any) compared to existing approaches. The absence of a detailed comparison with other augmentation methods makes it difficult to assess the true value of the proposed techniques.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit significantly from a more in-depth analysis of the underlying mechanisms that drive the observed acceleration of grokking. While the empirical results are interesting, the paper lacks a theoretical framework to explain why operand reversal and negation are effective. For example, the authors could explore the impact of these augmentations on the loss landscape, or analyze how they affect the model's ability to learn abstract representations of the mathematical operations. A deeper investigation into the symmetries and invariances of the problem could also provide a more principled justification for the chosen augmentations. Furthermore, the authors should consider exploring more sophisticated augmentation techniques, such as those based on adversarial examples or generative models, to see if they can achieve even faster grokking. This would help to establish the limits of the current approach and potentially lead to more robust and generalizable methods.\n\nTo strengthen the paper's contribution, the authors should conduct a more thorough comparison with existing data augmentation techniques. This would involve not only citing relevant papers but also implementing and evaluating these methods in the context of grokking in modular arithmetic. For instance, the authors could compare their approach to techniques like mixup or cutmix, which have been shown to be effective in other domains. This would help to establish the relative merits of the proposed augmentations and identify their specific strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the authors should explore the impact of different augmentation probabilities and combinations, to determine the optimal settings for each operation. A more systematic exploration of the hyperparameter space would make the results more robust and generalizable.\n\nFinally, the paper should include a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach. For example, the authors could discuss the potential for overfitting when using data augmentation, or the computational cost of applying these techniques. They should also consider the generalizability of their findings to other mathematical operations or datasets. A more critical and nuanced discussion of these limitations would help to put the paper's contribution into perspective and guide future research in this area. The authors should also consider exploring the impact of different model architectures on the effectiveness of the proposed augmentations. This would help to determine whether the observed benefits are specific to the transformer model used in the paper or whether they generalize to other types of models.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease see the weaknesses.\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 3\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper explores the impact of data augmentation on grokking in modular arithmetic operations, specifically focusing on addition, subtraction, and division.

The paper introduces a novel data augmentation strategy combining operand reversal and negation, which is specifically tailored for mathematical operations. This approach is original in the context of studying grokking dynamics.\n\n2. The paper is well-organized, with a clear problem statement, methodology, experimental setup, and results.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper's experimental setup is limited to a specific transformer architecture and a fixed set of hyperparameters. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings to other model architectures or hyperparameter settings. The authors should have explored a wider range of model architectures, such as recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks, and varied hyperparameters like the number of layers, hidden dimensions, and learning rates to assess the robustness of their data augmentation strategy. The lack of such exploration limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the broader applicability of their approach.\n\n2. The paper lacks a thorough discussion of related work, particularly in the area of data augmentation techniques for mathematical reasoning tasks. A more comprehensive literature review would help to contextualize the authors' contributions and highlight the novelty of their approach compared to existing methods. Specifically, the authors should discuss how their method compares to other augmentation techniques used in similar tasks, such as those involving symbolic manipulation or mathematical problem-solving.\n\n3. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by their data augmentation techniques. While the authors mention that the augmentations are applied probabilistically, they do not quantify the additional computational cost associated with these operations. A detailed analysis of the time and memory requirements would be valuable for assessing the practical feasibility of the proposed approach, especially when scaling to larger datasets or more complex models.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo address the limitations in the experimental setup, the authors should conduct a more extensive evaluation of their data augmentation strategy across a variety of model architectures and hyperparameter settings. This should include, but not be limited to, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTMs or GRUs, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in addition to the transformer model used. Furthermore, they should systematically vary key hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, hidden dimensions, learning rates, and batch sizes, to assess the sensitivity of their results to these parameters. This would provide a more robust understanding of the generalizability of their findings and the conditions under which their augmentation strategy is most effective. The authors should also consider using a grid search or random search approach to explore the hyperparameter space more thoroughly, rather than relying on a single set of fixed parameters. This would help to identify optimal configurations for their augmentation strategy and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its performance.\n\nTo improve the contextualization of their work, the authors should include a more detailed discussion of related work, particularly focusing on data augmentation techniques used in mathematical reasoning tasks. This should include a comparison of their approach to existing methods, highlighting the similarities and differences, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each. For example, they could discuss how their method compares to techniques like back-translation, synonym replacement, or adversarial augmentation, which have been used in other domains. This would help to clarify the novelty of their approach and its contribution to the field. The authors should also discuss the limitations of existing methods and how their approach addresses these limitations. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art in this area and the specific contributions of their work.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by their data augmentation techniques. This should include a quantification of the additional time and memory requirements associated with the augmentation operations, as well as an analysis of how these requirements scale with the size of the dataset and the complexity of the model. The authors should also discuss the trade-offs between the computational cost of the augmentation and the performance gains achieved. This would provide a more complete picture of the practical feasibility of their approach and help to guide future research in this area. For example, they could provide a table showing the training time and memory usage with and without augmentation, for different dataset sizes and model complexities. This would allow readers to assess the practical implications of using their proposed augmentation strategy.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. How does the proposed data augmentation strategy compare to other existing data augmentation techniques in terms of effectiveness and computational efficiency?\n\n2. What is the impact of varying the probabilities of operand reversal and negation on the grokking dynamics? Is there an optimal range for these probabilities that consistently enhances performance across different operations?\n\n3. How does the choice of the prime modulus p = 97 affect the generalizability of the results? Would using a different modulus, especially a larger one, significantly alter the observed grokking behavior?\n\n4. Can the findings be generalized to other types of mathematical operations beyond addition, subtraction, and division? If so, what modifications to the augmentation strategy might be necessary?\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 4\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper explores the impact of data augmentation on grokking dynamics in mathematical operations, specifically focusing on modular arithmetic.

The authors investigate how data augmentation techniques can accelerate the onset of grokking in a transformer model trained on addition, subtraction, and division modulo a prime number. Their core contribution lies in demonstrating that carefully chosen data augmentations, namely operand reversal and negation, can significantly reduce the number of training steps required for the model to achieve high generalization accuracy. The paper's methodology centers around applying these augmentations with varying probabilities across different arithmetic operations and then evaluating the model's performance on a validation set. The main empirical finding is that targeted data augmentation, particularly a combination of reversal and negation at a 15% probability, leads to a substantial reduction in the steps to reach 99% validation accuracy. For instance, in addition, they observe a reduction of up to 76% in training steps compared to the baseline, with similar improvements seen in subtraction and division. The authors also note that the effectiveness of different augmentation strategies varies across operations, with combined augmentation at 15% probability generally providing the best overall performance. The significance of this work lies in its potential to shed light on the mechanisms underlying grokking and to provide practical techniques for improving the training efficiency of neural networks in mathematical reasoning tasks. By demonstrating that data augmentation can accelerate generalization, the paper opens up new avenues for exploring the interplay between data manipulation and the emergence of abstract reasoning capabilities in neural networks. The paper's focus on modular arithmetic provides a controlled environment for studying these phenomena, and the findings could potentially be extended to other mathematical domains and reasoning tasks. The authors' work also highlights the importance of considering the specific characteristics of the task when designing data augmentation strategies, as the optimal approach may vary depending on the operation being learned. Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the growing body of research on grokking and provides a promising direction for future investigations into the role of data augmentation in enhancing the generalization capabilities of neural networks.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThis paper presents a well-structured and clearly written investigation into the impact of data augmentation on grokking in neural networks. The authors have successfully demonstrated that specific data augmentation techniques can significantly accelerate the generalization process in modular arithmetic tasks. The paper's strengths lie in its focused approach, clear methodology, and compelling empirical results. Firstly, the paper's core idea of using data augmentation to accelerate grokking is both novel and insightful. While data augmentation is a well-established technique in machine learning, its application to the specific problem of grokking in mathematical reasoning is a unique contribution. The authors' choice of operand reversal and negation as augmentation strategies is also well-motivated, as these techniques are intuitively linked to the underlying mathematical properties of the operations being studied. Secondly, the paper's methodology is rigorous and well-executed. The authors clearly define their experimental setup, including the choice of transformer model, the training procedure, and the evaluation metrics. The use of a fixed prime modulus and the consideration of three fundamental arithmetic operations provide a controlled environment for studying grokking. The systematic comparison of different augmentation strategies, including baseline conditions with no augmentation, reversal only, negation only, and combined reversal and negation at varying probabilities, allows for a thorough assessment of their effectiveness. The authors also provide a detailed description of the transformer architecture used, which enhances the reproducibility of their results. Thirdly, the empirical findings are compelling and provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation techniques. The observed reductions in the number of training steps to reach 99% validation accuracy are substantial and statistically significant. The authors' analysis of the varying effects of different augmentation strategies across operations is also insightful, highlighting the importance of task-specific considerations in data augmentation. The inclusion of training accuracy and loss curves further strengthens the paper's empirical contributions, providing a clear picture of the learning dynamics under different augmentation conditions. Finally, the paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The authors clearly articulate their research question, methodology, and findings. The use of figures and tables effectively complements the text, making the results accessible to a broad audience. The paper's clear and concise writing style contributes to its overall impact and makes it a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite its strengths, this paper has several limitations that warrant careful consideration. My primary concern is the limited scope of the experimental setup and the lack of generalizability of the findings. The paper focuses exclusively on a specific transformer architecture and a fixed set of hyperparameters. As stated in Section 3.1, the model consists of \"two decoder blocks, each with four attention heads,\" and the training procedure uses a fixed learning rate of 1e-3 and weight decay of 0.5 (Section 3.5). This narrow focus raises concerns about the robustness of the proposed data augmentation strategies. It is unclear whether the observed acceleration of grokking would generalize to other model architectures, such as recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks, or to different hyperparameter settings. The absence of experiments exploring the impact of varying the number of layers, hidden dimensions, or learning rates limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the broader applicability of the approach. This lack of exploration significantly impacts the paper's generalizability and leaves open the possibility that the observed benefits are specific to the chosen configuration. Secondly, the paper's discussion of related work is insufficient. While the authors mention the original grokking paper, they fail to adequately contextualize their work within the broader literature on data augmentation techniques for mathematical reasoning or symbolic manipulation. The absence of a dedicated \"Related Work\" section and the limited discussion in the \"Background\" (Section 2) make it difficult to assess the novelty of the proposed approach and its contribution to the field. Specifically, the paper does not compare its methods to other augmentation techniques used in similar tasks, such as back-translation, synonym replacement, or adversarial augmentation. This omission makes it challenging to determine the relative merits of the proposed techniques and to understand how they build upon or differ from existing approaches. The lack of a thorough literature review also hinders the reader's ability to fully appreciate the significance of the paper's findings. Thirdly, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the data augmentation techniques. While the authors claim in Section 3.5 that \"the computational overhead of our augmentation strategies is minimal,\" they do not provide any quantitative evidence to support this assertion. The absence of a detailed analysis of the time and memory requirements associated with the augmentation operations makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the proposed approach, especially when scaling to larger datasets or more complex models. This lack of quantitative analysis is a significant oversight, as computational efficiency is a crucial consideration in the practical application of machine learning techniques. Fourthly, the paper's analysis of the underlying mechanisms driving the observed acceleration of grokking is superficial. While the experiments demonstrate that data augmentation leads to faster generalization, the paper lacks a deeper investigation into why this occurs. The authors do not analyze the learned representations of the models trained with and without data augmentation, nor do they explore the impact of different augmentation probabilities and combinations on the grokking phenomenon. This lack of mechanistic understanding limits the paper's contribution to a purely empirical demonstration, without providing a deeper theoretical insight into the phenomenon. Finally, the paper's focus on modular arithmetic, while providing a controlled environment, limits the generalizability of the findings to other mathematical domains. The proposed augmentation techniques, operand reversal and negation, are specifically tailored to arithmetic operations with two operands and might not be directly applicable to other mathematical structures or problems with different input/output formats. The paper does not explore the applicability of these techniques to other types of mathematical problems, such as those involving matrices, complex numbers, or symbolic manipulation. This narrow focus restricts the broader impact of the work and raises questions about the generalizability of the findings beyond the specific context of modular arithmetic. These weaknesses, particularly the limited scope of the experiments, the lack of a thorough literature review, and the superficial analysis of the underlying mechanisms, significantly impact the paper's overall contribution and limit the confidence in the generalizability of its findings. The absence of a detailed computational analysis further undermines the practical implications of the proposed approach. While the paper presents compelling empirical results, these limitations need to be addressed to strengthen the paper's conclusions and broaden its impact.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I would suggest several concrete improvements. Firstly, the authors should significantly expand the experimental setup to include a wider range of model architectures and hyperparameter settings. This should involve experimenting with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as LSTMs or GRUs, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in addition to the transformer model used. Furthermore, they should systematically vary key hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, hidden dimensions, learning rates, and batch sizes, to assess the sensitivity of their results to these parameters. This would provide a more robust understanding of the generalizability of their findings and the conditions under which their augmentation strategy is most effective. A more thorough exploration of the hyperparameter space, perhaps using a grid search or random search approach, would help to identify optimal configurations for their augmentation strategy and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its performance. Secondly, the authors should conduct a more thorough comparison with existing data augmentation techniques. This would involve not only citing relevant papers but also implementing and evaluating these methods in the context of grokking in modular arithmetic. For instance, they could compare their approach to techniques like mixup or cutmix, which have been shown to be effective in other domains. This would help to establish the relative merits of the proposed augmentations and identify their specific strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, they should explore the impact of different augmentation probabilities and combinations, to determine the optimal settings for each operation. A more systematic exploration of the hyperparameter space would make the results more robust and generalizable. Thirdly, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by their data augmentation techniques. This should include a quantification of the additional time and memory requirements associated with the augmentation operations, as well as an analysis of how these requirements scale with the size of the dataset and the complexity of the model. The authors should also discuss the trade-offs between the computational cost of the augmentation and the performance gains achieved. This would provide a more complete picture of the practical feasibility of their approach and help to guide future research in this area. For example, they could provide a table showing the training time and memory usage with and without augmentation, for different dataset sizes and model complexities. Fourthly, the authors should delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms that drive the observed acceleration of grokking. This could involve analyzing the learned representations of the models trained with and without data augmentation, to understand how the augmentations affect the model's ability to capture the underlying mathematical structures. Furthermore, they could explore the impact of different augmentation probabilities and combinations on the grokking phenomenon. A more thorough analysis of these aspects would provide a deeper understanding of the proposed method and its potential for broader applications. This could involve techniques such as visualizing the model's internal representations or analyzing the loss landscape to understand how the augmentations affect the optimization process. Fifthly, the authors should broaden the scope of their investigation to include other mathematical domains and problems. This could involve exploring the applicability of their augmentation techniques to problems involving matrices, complex numbers, or symbolic manipulation. This would help to establish the generalizability of their findings and identify potential limitations of their approach. For example, they could investigate how their techniques perform on tasks involving algebraic equations or calculus problems. Finally, the authors should include a more detailed discussion of the limitations of their approach. This should include a discussion of the potential for overfitting when using data augmentation, or the computational cost of applying these techniques. They should also consider the generalizability of their findings to other mathematical operations or datasets. A more critical and nuanced discussion of these limitations would help to put the paper's contribution into perspective and guide future research in this area. The authors should also consider exploring the impact of different model architectures on the effectiveness of the proposed augmentations. This would help to determine whether the observed benefits are specific to the transformer model used in the paper or whether they generalize to other types of models. By addressing these suggestions, the authors can significantly strengthen their paper and enhance its contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nSeveral key questions arise from my analysis of this paper. Firstly, how does the proposed data augmentation strategy compare to other existing data augmentation techniques in terms of effectiveness and computational efficiency? While the paper demonstrates the efficacy of operand reversal and negation, it does not provide a comparative analysis with other established methods. A deeper understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different augmentation techniques would be valuable for contextualizing the paper's contribution. Secondly, what is the impact of varying the probabilities of operand reversal and negation on the grokking dynamics? The paper explores two specific probabilities (15% and 30%), but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of different probability values. A more systematic exploration of the probability space could reveal optimal settings for each operation and provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between augmentation probability and grokking. Thirdly, how does the choice of the prime modulus p = 97 affect the generalizability of the results? The paper uses a specific prime modulus, but it does not investigate the impact of using different moduli, especially larger ones. Understanding how the choice of modulus affects the grokking behavior is crucial for assessing the broader applicability of the findings. Would using a larger prime lead to different grokking dynamics, and would the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation strategies change? Fourthly, can the findings be generalized to other types of mathematical operations beyond addition, subtraction, and division? The paper focuses on these three fundamental operations, but it does not explore the applicability of its techniques to other mathematical domains, such as multiplication, exponentiation, or modular inverses. Investigating the effectiveness of the proposed augmentations on a wider range of operations would provide a more comprehensive understanding of their generalizability. Fifthly, what is the theoretical basis for the observed acceleration of grokking due to data augmentation? While the paper demonstrates the empirical benefits of augmentation, it does not provide a theoretical explanation for why these techniques are effective. A deeper theoretical analysis, perhaps based on the symmetries or invariances of the underlying mathematical operations, would be valuable for understanding the fundamental mechanisms driving the observed phenomena. Finally, how do the proposed augmentation techniques affect the model's ability to learn abstract representations of the mathematical operations? The paper does not analyze the internal representations learned by the model, and it is unclear how the augmentations influence the model's understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. Investigating the impact of data augmentation on the model's learned representations could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying grokking and the role of data manipulation in enhancing generalization. Addressing these questions would significantly enhance the paper's contribution and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of data augmentation in grokking.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n4.0\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

The authors proposed two data-augmentation techniques: (1) operand reversal, i.e., swapping the order of operands for addition; (2) operand negation, i.e., negating one or both of the operands.

The proposed data-augmentation method is specifically designed for modular arithmetic. It is not clear if it can be generalized to other types of mathematical problems.\n2. The authors only conducted experiments with a specific transformer-based model. It is not clear if the proposed method is effective on other model architectures.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe primary weakness of this paper lies in the limited scope of the proposed data augmentation techniques. While the results demonstrate effectiveness within modular arithmetic, the lack of exploration into other mathematical domains significantly restricts the impact and generalizability of the findings. For instance, the operand reversal technique, which swaps the order of operands, is specifically tailored to the commutative property of addition and does not have a clear application in non-commutative operations such as matrix multiplication or function composition. Similarly, operand negation, while useful in modular arithmetic, may not be directly applicable to problems involving complex numbers or abstract algebraic structures. To strengthen the paper, the authors should investigate the applicability of their methods to a broader range of mathematical problems, potentially by identifying common properties or structures that allow for similar augmentation strategies. This could involve exploring problems with varying degrees of commutativity, different number systems, or operations with multiple inputs. \n\nFurthermore, the paper's reliance on a single transformer-based model raises concerns about the method's robustness and general applicability. While transformers have shown success in various tasks, it is crucial to demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation is not overly tailored to this specific architecture. Different model architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs), may exhibit different learning dynamics and sensitivities to data augmentation. For example, RNNs, which process sequences iteratively, might benefit from different types of augmentations compared to the parallel processing nature of transformers. Similarly, GNNs, which operate on graph structures, may require augmentations that preserve the underlying graph topology. Therefore, the authors should conduct experiments with a diverse set of model architectures to establish the method's effectiveness across different learning paradigms. This would not only strengthen the paper's claims but also provide valuable insights into the interplay between data augmentation and model architecture.\n\nFinally, the paper would benefit from a more detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the observed acceleration of grokking. While the experiments demonstrate that data augmentation leads to faster generalization, the paper lacks a deeper investigation into why this occurs. For example, it would be beneficial to analyze the learned representations of the models trained with and without data augmentation, to understand how the augmentations affect the model's ability to capture the underlying mathematical structures.

The authors introduce a novel data augmentation strategy combining operand reversal and negation, applied with varying probabilities to different operations (addition, subtraction, and division). They use a transformer-based model and conduct experiments across five conditions: no augmentation (baseline), reversal augmentation, negation augmentation, and two levels of combined augmentation (15% and 30% probability each). The results show that targeted data augmentation can significantly accelerate grokking, reducing the steps to reach 99% validation accuracy by up to 76% for addition, 72% for subtraction, and 66% for division. The authors conclude that different augmentation strategies have varying effects across operations, with combined augmentation at 15% probability providing the best overall performance.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3\n\n### Presentation\n\n3\n\n### Contribution\n\n3\n\n### Strengths\n\n1.

The paper mainly studies the grokking phenomenon in mathematical operations, focusing on modular arithmetic. Although the authors provide some insights into the varying effects of different augmentation strategies on grokking dynamics for different operations, the overall contribution to the field is incremental rather than groundbreaking. The core idea of using data augmentation to improve generalization is not novel, and the specific augmentations (reversal and negation) are relatively simple. The paper lacks a deeper theoretical analysis of why these augmentations lead to faster grokking, and it does not explore more complex or less intuitive augmentation strategies.\n2. The novelty of the proposed augmentation methods is questionable. The two proposed methods, operand reversal and negation, are common techniques in data preprocessing and augmentation. While the authors apply these techniques to the specific problem of grokking in modular arithmetic, the methods themselves are not new. The paper does not adequately justify why these particular augmentations are expected to be effective for this problem, beyond the intuitive notion that they increase the diversity of the training data. A more rigorous justification, perhaps based on the symmetries or invariances of the underlying mathematical operations, would be beneficial.\n3. The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of related work. While the authors mention the original grokking paper, they do not adequately discuss other relevant work on data augmentation techniques for improving generalization in machine learning, particularly in the context of mathematical reasoning or symbolic manipulation. A more thorough literature review would help to contextualize the paper's contribution and highlight its unique aspects (if any) compared to existing approaches. The absence of a detailed comparison with other augmentation methods makes it difficult to assess the true value of the proposed techniques.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit significantly from a more in-depth analysis of the underlying mechanisms that drive the observed acceleration of grokking. While the empirical results are interesting, the paper lacks a theoretical framework to explain why operand reversal and negation are effective. For example, the authors could explore the impact of these augmentations on the loss landscape, or analyze how they affect the model's ability to learn abstract representations of the mathematical operations. A deeper investigation into the symmetries and invariances of the problem could also provide a more principled justification for the chosen augmentations. Furthermore, the authors should consider exploring more sophisticated augmentation techniques, such as those based on adversarial examples or generative models, to see if they can achieve even faster grokking. This would help to establish the limits of the current approach and potentially lead to more robust and generalizable methods.\n\nTo strengthen the paper's contribution, the authors should conduct a more thorough comparison with existing data augmentation techniques. This would involve not only citing relevant papers but also implementing and evaluating these methods in the context of grokking in modular arithmetic. For instance, the authors could compare their approach to techniques like mixup or cutmix, which have been shown to be effective in other domains. This would help to establish the relative merits of the proposed augmentations and identify their specific strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the authors should explore the impact of different augmentation probabilities and combinations, to determine the optimal settings for each operation. A more systematic exploration of the hyperparameter space would make the results more robust and generalizable.\n\nFinally, the paper should include a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach. For example, the authors could discuss the potential for overfitting when using data augmentation, or the computational cost of applying these techniques. They should also consider the generalizability of their findings to other mathematical operations or datasets. A more critical and nuanced discussion of these limitations would help to put the paper's contribution into perspective and guide future research in this area. The authors should also consider exploring the impact of different model architectures on the effectiveness of the proposed augmentations. This would help to determine whether the observed benefits are specific to the transformer model used in the paper or whether they generalize to other types of models.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease see the weaknesses.\n\n### Rating\n\n5\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********"

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper delves into the intriguing phenomenon of grokking in neural networks, specifically within the context of modular arithmetic. The authors investigate how data augmentation techniques can accelerate the onset of grokking in a transformer model trained on addition, subtraction, and division modulo a prime number. Their core contribution lies in demonstrating that carefully chosen data augmentations, namely operand reversal and negation, can significantly reduce the number of training steps required for the model to achieve high generalization accuracy. The paper's methodology centers around applying these augmentations with varying probabilities across different arithmetic operations and then evaluating the model's performance on a validation set. The main empirical finding is that targeted data augmentation, particularly a combination of reversal and negation at a 15% probability, leads to a substantial reduction in the steps to reach 99% validation accuracy. For instance, in addition, they observe a reduction of up to 76% in training steps compared to the baseline, with similar improvements seen in subtraction and division. The authors also note that the effectiveness of different augmentation strategies varies across operations, with combined augmentation at 15% probability generally providing the best overall performance. The significance of this work lies in its potential to shed light on the mechanisms underlying grokking and to provide practical techniques for improving the training efficiency of neural networks in mathematical reasoning tasks. By demonstrating that data augmentation can accelerate generalization, the paper opens up new avenues for exploring the interplay between data manipulation and the emergence of abstract reasoning capabilities in neural networks. The paper's focus on modular arithmetic provides a controlled environment for studying these phenomena, and the findings could potentially be extended to other mathematical domains and reasoning tasks. The authors' work also highlights the importance of considering the specific characteristics of the task when designing data augmentation strategies, as the optimal approach may vary depending on the operation being learned. Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the growing body of research on grokking and provides a promising direction for future investigations into the role of data augmentation in enhancing the generalization capabilities of neural networks.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThis paper presents a well-structured and clearly written investigation into the impact of data augmentation on grokking in neural networks. The authors have successfully demonstrated that specific data augmentation techniques can significantly accelerate the generalization process in modular arithmetic tasks. The paper's strengths lie in its focused approach, clear methodology, and compelling empirical results. Firstly, the paper's core idea of using data augmentation to accelerate grokking is both novel and insightful. While data augmentation is a well-established technique in machine learning, its application to the specific problem of grokking in mathematical reasoning is a unique contribution. The authors' choice of operand reversal and negation as augmentation strategies is also well-motivated, as these techniques are intuitively linked to the underlying mathematical properties of the operations being studied. Secondly, the paper's methodology is rigorous and well-executed. The authors clearly define their experimental setup, including the choice of transformer model, the training procedure, and the evaluation metrics. The use of a fixed prime modulus and the consideration of three fundamental arithmetic operations provide a controlled environment for studying grokking. The systematic comparison of different augmentation strategies, including baseline conditions with no augmentation, reversal only, negation only, and combined reversal and negation at varying probabilities, allows for a thorough assessment of their effectiveness. The authors also provide a detailed description of the transformer architecture used, which enhances the reproducibility of their results. Thirdly, the empirical findings are compelling and provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation techniques. The observed reductions in the number of training steps to reach 99% validation accuracy are substantial and statistically significant. The authors' analysis of the varying effects of different augmentation strategies across operations is also insightful, highlighting the importance of task-specific considerations in data augmentation. The inclusion of training accuracy and loss curves further strengthens the paper's empirical contributions, providing a clear picture of the learning dynamics under different augmentation conditions. Finally, the paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The authors clearly articulate their research question, methodology, and findings. The use of figures and tables effectively complements the text, making the results accessible to a broad audience. The paper's clear and concise writing style contributes to its overall impact and makes it a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite its strengths, this paper has several limitations that warrant careful consideration. My primary concern is the limited scope of the experimental setup and the lack of generalizability of the findings. The paper focuses exclusively on a specific transformer architecture and a fixed set of hyperparameters. As stated in Section 3.1, the model consists of \"two decoder blocks, each with four attention heads,\" and the training procedure uses a fixed learning rate of 1e-3 and weight decay of 0.5 (Section 3.5). This narrow focus raises concerns about the robustness of the proposed data augmentation strategies. It is unclear whether the observed acceleration of grokking would generalize to other model architectures, such as recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks, or to different hyperparameter settings. The absence of experiments exploring the impact of varying the number of layers, hidden dimensions, or learning rates limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the broader applicability of the approach. This lack of exploration significantly impacts the paper's generalizability and leaves open the possibility that the observed benefits are specific to the chosen configuration. Secondly, the paper's discussion of related work is insufficient. While the authors mention the original grokking paper, they fail to adequately contextualize their work within the broader literature on data augmentation techniques for mathematical reasoning or symbolic manipulation. The absence of a dedicated \"Related Work\" section and the limited discussion in the \"Background\" (Section 2) make it difficult to assess the novelty of the proposed approach and its contribution to the field. Specifically, the paper does not compare its methods to other augmentation techniques used in similar tasks, such as back-translation, synonym replacement, or adversarial augmentation. This omission makes it challenging to determine the relative merits of the proposed techniques and to understand how they build upon or differ from existing approaches. The lack of a thorough literature review also hinders the reader's ability to fully appreciate the significance of the paper's findings. Thirdly, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the data augmentation techniques. While the authors claim in Section 3.5 that \"the computational overhead of our augmentation strategies is minimal,\" they do not provide any quantitative evidence to support this assertion. The absence of a detailed analysis of the time and memory requirements associated with the augmentation operations makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the proposed approach, especially when scaling to larger datasets or more complex models. This lack of quantitative analysis is a significant oversight, as computational efficiency is a crucial consideration in the practical application of machine learning techniques. Fourthly, the paper's analysis of the underlying mechanisms driving the observed acceleration of grokking is superficial. While the experiments demonstrate that data augmentation leads to faster generalization, the paper lacks a deeper investigation into why this occurs. The authors do not analyze the learned representations of the models trained with and without data augmentation, nor do they explore the impact of different augmentation probabilities and combinations on the grokking phenomenon. This lack of mechanistic understanding limits the paper's contribution to a purely empirical demonstration, without providing a deeper theoretical insight into the phenomenon. Finally, the paper's focus on modular arithmetic, while providing a controlled environment, limits the generalizability of the findings to other mathematical domains. The proposed augmentation techniques, operand reversal and negation, are specifically tailored to arithmetic operations with two operands and might not be directly applicable to other mathematical structures or problems with different input/output formats. The paper does not explore the applicability of these techniques to other types of mathematical problems, such as those involving matrices, complex numbers, or symbolic manipulation. This narrow focus restricts the broader impact of the work and raises questions about the generalizability of the findings beyond the specific context of modular arithmetic. These weaknesses, particularly the limited scope of the experiments, the lack of a thorough literature review, and the superficial analysis of the underlying mechanisms, significantly impact the paper's overall contribution and limit the confidence in the generalizability of its findings. The absence of a detailed computational analysis further undermines the practical implications of the proposed approach. While the paper presents compelling empirical results, these limitations need to be addressed to strengthen the paper's conclusions and broaden its impact.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I would suggest several concrete improvements. Firstly, the authors should significantly expand the experimental setup to include a wider range of model architectures and hyperparameter settings. This should involve experimenting with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as LSTMs or GRUs, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in addition to the transformer model used. Furthermore, they should systematically vary key hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, hidden dimensions, learning rates, and batch sizes, to assess the sensitivity of their results to these parameters. This would provide a more robust understanding of the generalizability of their findings and the conditions under which their augmentation strategy is most effective. A more thorough exploration of the hyperparameter space, perhaps using a grid search or random search approach, would help to identify optimal configurations for their augmentation strategy and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its performance. Secondly, the authors should conduct a more thorough comparison with existing data augmentation techniques. This would involve not only citing relevant papers but also implementing and evaluating these methods in the context of grokking in modular arithmetic. For instance, they could compare their approach to techniques like mixup or cutmix, which have been shown to be effective in other domains. This would help to establish the relative merits of the proposed augmentations and identify their specific strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, they should explore the impact of different augmentation probabilities and combinations, to determine the optimal settings for each operation. A more systematic exploration of the hyperparameter space would make the results more robust and generalizable. Thirdly, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by their data augmentation techniques. This should include a quantification of the additional time and memory requirements associated with the augmentation operations, as well as an analysis of how these requirements scale with the size of the dataset and the complexity of the model. The authors should also discuss the trade-offs between the computational cost of the augmentation and the performance gains achieved. This would provide a more complete picture of the practical feasibility of their approach and help to guide future research in this area. For example, they could provide a table showing the training time and memory usage with and without augmentation, for different dataset sizes and model complexities. Fourthly, the authors should delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms that drive the observed acceleration of grokking. This could involve analyzing the learned representations of the models trained with and without data augmentation, to understand how the augmentations affect the model's ability to capture the underlying mathematical structures. Furthermore, they could explore the impact of different augmentation probabilities and combinations on the grokking phenomenon. A more thorough analysis of these aspects would provide a deeper understanding of the proposed method and its potential for broader applications. This could involve techniques such as visualizing the model's internal representations or analyzing the loss landscape to understand how the augmentations affect the optimization process. Fifthly, the authors should broaden the scope of their investigation to include other mathematical domains and problems. This could involve exploring the applicability of their augmentation techniques to problems involving matrices, complex numbers, or symbolic manipulation. This would help to establish the generalizability of their findings and identify potential limitations of their approach. For example, they could investigate how their techniques perform on tasks involving algebraic equations or calculus problems. Finally, the authors should include a more detailed discussion of the limitations of their approach. This should include a discussion of the potential for overfitting when using data augmentation, or the computational cost of applying these techniques. They should also consider the generalizability of their findings to other mathematical operations or datasets. A more critical and nuanced discussion of these limitations would help to put the paper's contribution into perspective and guide future research in this area. The authors should also consider exploring the impact of different model architectures on the effectiveness of the proposed augmentations. This would help to determine whether the observed benefits are specific to the transformer model used in the paper or whether they generalize to other types of models. By addressing these suggestions, the authors can significantly strengthen their paper and enhance its contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nSeveral key questions arise from my analysis of this paper. Firstly, how does the proposed data augmentation strategy compare to other existing data augmentation techniques in terms of effectiveness and computational efficiency? While the paper demonstrates the efficacy of operand reversal and negation, it does not provide a comparative analysis with other established methods. A deeper understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different augmentation techniques would be valuable for contextualizing the paper's contribution. Secondly, what is the impact of varying the probabilities of operand reversal and negation on the grokking dynamics? The paper explores two specific probabilities (15% and 30%), but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of different probability values. A more systematic exploration of the probability space could reveal optimal settings for each operation and provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between augmentation probability and grokking. Thirdly, how does the choice of the prime modulus p = 97 affect the generalizability of the results? The paper uses a specific prime modulus, but it does not investigate the impact of using different moduli, especially larger ones. Understanding how the choice of modulus affects the grokking behavior is crucial for assessing the broader applicability of the findings. Would using a larger prime lead to different grokking dynamics, and would the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation strategies change? Fourthly, can the findings be generalized to other types of mathematical operations beyond addition, subtraction, and division? The paper focuses on these three fundamental operations, but it does not explore the applicability of its techniques to other mathematical domains, such as multiplication, exponentiation, or modular inverses. Investigating the effectiveness of the proposed augmentations on a wider range of operations would provide a more comprehensive understanding of their generalizability. Fifthly, what is the theoretical basis for the observed acceleration of grokking due to data augmentation? While the paper demonstrates the empirical benefits of augmentation, it does not provide a theoretical explanation for why these techniques are effective. A deeper theoretical analysis, perhaps based on the symmetries or invariances of the underlying mathematical operations, would be valuable for understanding the fundamental mechanisms driving the observed phenomena. Finally, how do the proposed augmentation techniques affect the model's ability to learn abstract representations of the mathematical operations? The paper does not analyze the internal representations learned by the model, and it is unclear how the augmentations influence the model's understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. Investigating the impact of data augmentation on the model's learned representations could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying grokking and the role of data manipulation in enhancing generalization. Addressing these questions would significantly enhance the paper's contribution and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of data augmentation in grokking.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n4.0\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",

The paper does not analyze the internal representations learned by the model, and it is unclear how the augmentations influence the model's understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. Investigating the impact of data augmentation on the model's learned representations could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying grokking and the role of data manipulation in enhancing generalization. Addressing these questions would significantly enhance the paper's contribution and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of data augmentation in grokking."

Specifically, the authors apply Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, to learn the optimal policy for adjusting the learning rate based on the current state of training. The state is defined by the validation loss and the current learning rate, while the reward function encourages validation loss reduction and learning rate stability. Through experiments on three datasets, the authors demonstrate that the proposed Q-learning approach outperforms baseline methods using static or heuristic-based learning rate schedules, achieving lower validation losses and improved training efficiency.\n\n### Soundness\n\n1\n\n### Presentation\n\n1\n\n### Contribution\n\n1\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper explores the use of reinforcement learning to optimize hyperparameters in deep learning models. This is an interesting and timely topic, as hyperparameter optimization is a challenging and time-consuming task in deep learning. The paper specifically focuses on the learning rate, which is one of the most important hyperparameters in deep learning.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### comment\n\nThe paper has several weaknesses that limit its impact and generalizability.\n\nLack of Novelty: The paper does not adequately differentiate itself from existing work on reinforcement learning for learning rate adaptation. The authors should clearly articulate the novelty of their approach and how it differs from previous work. The paper only has very limited related work and it's the same for RL in general and for learning rate adaptation. The authors should expand their related work to include more specific references to reinforcement learning for learning rate adaptation, and should clearly articulate how their approach differs from existing methods.\n\nLimited Experimental Evaluation: The paper evaluates the proposed approach on only three datasets, which is insufficient to demonstrate its generalizability. The authors should evaluate their approach on a wider range of datasets and tasks to demonstrate its effectiveness. The chosen datasets are also not very diverse, as they are all language modeling tasks.\n\nLack of Theoretical Analysis: The paper does not provide any theoretical analysis of the proposed approach. The authors should provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence and stability properties of their Q-learning algorithm.\n\nOverreliance on Validation Loss: The state space is defined solely based on the validation loss, which may not capture the full complexity of the training process. The authors should consider incorporating other factors, such as training loss, gradient norms, or model parameters, to provide a more comprehensive representation of the training state. This could potentially lead to more robust and effective learning rate adaptation.\n\nInadequate Reward Function: The reward function is not adequately justified, and its impact on the Q-learning agent's behavior is not thoroughly analyzed. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the reward function and its design choices. They should also analyze how the reward function affects the agent's behavior and performance.\n\nInconsistent and Incomplete Results: The results presented in the paper are inconsistent and incomplete. The authors should provide a more thorough analysis of their experimental results and address any inconsistencies or missing data. For example, the results in Table 1 show that the Q-learning approach does not consistently outperform the baseline methods. In some cases, the baseline methods achieve lower validation losses. The authors should provide a more detailed analysis of these results and explain why the Q-learning approach does not consistently outperform the baseline methods.\n\nLack of Ablation Studies: The paper does not include ablation studies to evaluate the impact of different components of the proposed approach. The authors should include ablation studies to evaluate the impact of different components of their approach, such as the state space, action space, and reward function. This would help to identify the most important factors contributing to the performance of the Q-learning algorithm.\n\n### Questions\n\nHere are some specific questions and suggestions for the authors:\n\nClarify Novelty: What is the novelty of your approach compared to existing work on reinforcement learning for learning rate adaptation? Please provide a clear and concise explanation of how your approach differs from previous methods.\n\nExpand Related Work: Please expand your related work to include more specific references to reinforcement learning for learning rate adaptation, and should clearly articulate how their approach differs from existing methods.\n\nTheoretical Analysis: Can you provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence and stability properties of your Q-learning algorithm?\n\nState Space: Why did you choose to define the state space solely based on the validation loss? Have you considered incorporating other factors, such as training loss, gradient norms, or model parameters? How would these additional factors affect the performance of your Q-learning algorithm?\n\nReward Function: Can you provide a more detailed explanation of your reward function and its design choices?

This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of your approach.\n\n### Rating\n\n1\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes a Q-learning based approach that uses the validation loss and current learning rate as the state, adjusting the learning rate to optimize the training process. The experiments on multiple datasets, including shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8, demonstrate that the RL-based learning rate adaptation leads to faster convergence and better final performance compared to traditional methods.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n1\n\n### Contribution\n\n1\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically adapt the learning rate during transformer model training, aiming to enhance training efficiency and model performance by automatically adjusting the learning rate based on training progress.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The writing is poor, with some tables and figures not being referenced in the paper, such as Figure 4. Some tables and figures are not even mentioned in the appendix, such as Table 3. The lack of references to these elements makes it difficult to understand their relevance and how they support the claims made in the paper. The reader is left to guess the purpose of these tables and figures, which significantly hinders the paper's clarity and flow.\n\n2. The paper lacks comparisons with other baselines. The results presented in Table 1 are not convincing, as the final training loss and validation loss show little difference. The absence of comparisons with more sophisticated learning rate scheduling techniques, such as cosine annealing with warm-up or cyclical learning rates, makes it hard to assess the true effectiveness of the proposed Q-learning approach. The small differences in loss values raise concerns about the practical significance of the proposed method.\n\n3. The paper lacks novelty. There are many papers on using RL to adjust learning rates, such as https://openreview.net/forum?id=5OUm5KMrJM and https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09799. This paper does not compare or improve upon those works. The paper fails to articulate how its approach differs from existing methods, and it does not demonstrate any clear advantages over prior work. The lack of a clear contribution makes it difficult to justify the paper's publication.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper needs significant improvements in its presentation and experimental validation. First, the authors must ensure that all tables and figures are properly referenced within the text, including the appendix. Each table and figure should be explicitly discussed, explaining its purpose and how it relates to the paper's claims. For example, when introducing Figure 4, the authors should explain what specific aspect of the results it is meant to illustrate and how those results support their conclusions. Similarly, Table 3 should be discussed in the context of the ablation study, detailing the specific variations being compared and the implications of the observed results. This will greatly improve the paper's readability and ensure that the reader can follow the authors' line of reasoning.\n\nSecond, the experimental section needs to be significantly strengthened by including comparisons with a wider range of baseline methods. The current comparison is insufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Q-learning approach. The authors should include comparisons with more advanced learning rate scheduling techniques, such as cosine annealing with warm-up, cyclical learning rates, and other adaptive methods. These comparisons should be performed on all datasets, and the results should be presented with clear statistical significance analysis. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the learning curves, highlighting the specific scenarios where the Q-learning approach outperforms the baselines. This will provide a more robust evaluation of the proposed method and allow the reader to assess its practical value.\n\nFinally, the authors need to clearly articulate the novelty of their approach and how it differs from existing methods. The paper should include a detailed comparison with prior work on RL-based learning rate adjustment, highlighting the specific limitations of those methods and how the proposed approach addresses those limitations. The authors should also provide a theoretical analysis of their method, explaining why it is expected to perform better than existing approaches. This will help to establish the paper's contribution and justify its publication. Without a clear demonstration of novelty and a thorough comparison with existing methods, the paper's contribution remains unclear.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

The paper introduces a novel application of Q-learning for dynamic learning rate adaptation in transformer training, which is a creative extension of reinforcement learning to hyperparameter optimization.\n2. The method is evaluated on multiple datasets, showing consistent improvements in convergence speed and final performance metrics compared to baseline methods.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper lacks comparisons with other RL-based learning rate adaptation methods, limiting the assessment of its relative performance. Specifically, the paper does not compare against methods that use policy gradient approaches or actor-critic methods, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method's strengths and weaknesses.\n2. The experimental evaluation is limited to three datasets, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method. The chosen datasets, while diverse in size, are all language modeling tasks. It is unclear how the method would perform on other types of tasks, such as image classification or sequence-to-sequence tasks.\n3. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the Q-learning agent. While the paper mentions faster convergence, it does not quantify the additional computational cost of running the Q-learning algorithm itself, which could be significant, especially for larger models and datasets.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo strengthen the paper, the authors should include a more comprehensive comparison with other reinforcement learning-based learning rate adaptation methods. Specifically, they should compare their Q-learning approach against policy gradient methods, such as REINFORCE, and actor-critic methods, like A2C or PPO. This would provide a more complete picture of the proposed method's performance relative to other RL techniques. The comparison should not only focus on final performance metrics but also on convergence speed and stability. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to analyze the sensitivity of the Q-learning method to different hyperparameter settings, such as the learning rate for the Q-network, the discount factor, and the exploration strategy. This analysis would provide insights into the robustness of the method and its practical applicability.\n\nTo address the limited generalizability of the experimental evaluation, the authors should include experiments on a wider range of tasks beyond language modeling. For example, they could evaluate the method on image classification tasks using datasets like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, or on sequence-to-sequence tasks using datasets like Machine Translation datasets. This would demonstrate the method's ability to adapt to different types of data and model architectures. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the method's performance across different dataset sizes and model complexities. This would help to understand the scalability of the method and its limitations. The authors should also consider reporting the variance in performance across multiple runs to ensure the robustness of the results.\n\nFinally, the paper needs a more detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the Q-learning agent. The authors should provide a breakdown of the computational cost associated with each component of the Q-learning algorithm, such as the forward and backward passes for the Q-network, the update of the Q-table, and the exploration process. This analysis should be compared to the computational cost of traditional learning rate schedules. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the impact of the Q-learning overhead on the overall training time and resource consumption. This would provide a more complete understanding of the practical trade-offs between the proposed method and traditional approaches. The authors should also consider techniques to reduce the computational overhead of the Q-learning agent, such as using a smaller Q-network or employing more efficient update rules.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. How does the proposed Q-learning approach compare to other reinforcement learning methods for learning rate adaptation, such as policy gradient methods or actor-critic algorithms?\n2. What is the computational overhead of using the Q-learning agent during training compared to traditional learning rate schedules?\n3. Can the authors provide more details on the sensitivity of the method to different hyperparameter settings in the Q-learning algorithm, such as the learning rate for the Q-network and the discount factor?\n\n### Rating\n\n6\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********\n\n}\n\nI have finished generating simulated reviews from 4 reviewers.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a Q-learning based approach for dynamically adjusting the learning rate during the training of transformer models, aiming to enhance training efficiency and model performance. The core idea is to treat the learning rate adaptation as a reinforcement learning problem, where the state is defined by the current validation loss, learning rate, and training iteration, and the action is the adjustment to the learning rate. The reward function is designed to encourage both a reduction in validation loss and stability in the learning rate. The authors evaluate their approach on three language modeling datasets: shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8, comparing the Q-learning method against static and heuristic-based learning rate schedules. The empirical results, presented in Table 1, show that the Q-learning approach achieves comparable or slightly better validation losses in some cases, but not consistently across all datasets. Specifically, while the Q-learning method shows a marginal improvement on enwik8 and text8, it performs slightly worse on shakespeare_char compared to the baseline. The paper also includes ablation studies that explore the impact of different initial learning rates, reward signals, and epsilon decay strategies on the performance of the Q-learning agent. While the paper presents an interesting application of reinforcement learning to learning rate adaptation, the lack of a comprehensive comparison with other RL-based methods, the limited experimental evaluation, and the absence of a theoretical analysis raise concerns about the overall significance and generalizability of the proposed approach. The paper's claim of consistent outperformance by the Q-learning method is not fully supported by the empirical results, and the lack of ablation studies on key components like the state and action space further limits the insights gained from this work. Overall, while the paper explores a promising direction, it requires further refinement and more rigorous evaluation to establish its contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe primary strength of this paper lies in its exploration of reinforcement learning, specifically Q-learning, for the task of dynamic learning rate adaptation in transformer models. This is a timely and relevant problem, as the selection of an appropriate learning rate schedule is crucial for efficient and effective training of deep learning models. The paper's approach of framing learning rate adjustment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and using Q-learning to learn an optimal policy is a creative and potentially valuable contribution. The authors clearly define the state space, action space, and reward function, providing a concrete implementation of their proposed method. Furthermore, the paper includes ablation studies that investigate the impact of different initial learning rates, reward signals, and epsilon decay strategies on the performance of the Q-learning agent. These ablation studies, while not comprehensive, offer some insights into the sensitivity of the method to different hyperparameter settings. The paper also provides a clear description of the experimental setup, including the datasets used and the baseline methods compared against. The use of three different datasets, albeit all language modeling tasks, provides some evidence of the method's applicability across different data distributions. Finally, the paper's focus on a model-free RL algorithm like Q-learning, which does not require a differentiable reward signal, is a practical advantage over policy gradient methods, making it potentially more accessible for a wider range of applications. Despite the limitations identified, the paper's exploration of Q-learning for learning rate adaptation is a valuable contribution to the field and provides a foundation for future research.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nAfter a thorough examination of the paper, I've identified several key weaknesses that significantly impact its overall contribution and validity. First, the paper suffers from a lack of novelty in its approach. While the authors propose using Q-learning for learning rate adaptation, they fail to adequately differentiate their work from existing research in this area. The related work section is limited and does not include specific references to other reinforcement learning-based methods for learning rate adaptation, such as those found in the papers provided by the reviewer (https://openreview.net/forum?id=5OUm5KMrJM and https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09799). The authors mention that their approach differs from policy gradient methods, but they do not discuss how their Q-learning approach compares to other Q-learning based methods for learning rate adaptation. This lack of a comprehensive comparison makes it difficult to assess the unique contribution of this work. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the absence of these critical comparisons is clearly evident in the paper. Second, the experimental evaluation is limited in scope and diversity. The authors evaluate their approach on only three datasets, all of which are language modeling tasks. This lack of diversity makes it difficult to generalize the findings to other types of tasks, such as image classification or sequence-to-sequence tasks. Furthermore, the paper does not include comparisons with more advanced learning rate scheduling techniques, such as cosine annealing with warm-up or cyclical learning rates. The absence of these comparisons makes it challenging to assess the true effectiveness of the proposed Q-learning approach. The results presented in Table 1 show that the Q-learning approach does not consistently outperform the baseline methods. In some cases, the baseline methods achieve lower validation losses, specifically on the shakespeare_char dataset. This inconsistency undermines the paper's claim of superior performance. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the limited dataset diversity and the lack of comparisons with advanced baselines are clearly visible in the experimental section. Third, the paper lacks a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach. The authors do not provide any mathematical proofs or analysis of the convergence or stability properties of their Q-learning algorithm. This absence of theoretical grounding makes it difficult to understand the behavior of the algorithm and its limitations. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not include any theoretical analysis section. Fourth, the state space is defined solely based on the validation loss, current learning rate, and training iteration. While the inclusion of the training iteration is a positive aspect, the state space could be more comprehensive by incorporating other factors, such as training loss, gradient norms, or model parameters. These additional factors could provide a richer representation of the training dynamics and potentially lead to more robust and effective learning rate adaptation. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as the state space does include the training iteration, but the lack of other potentially informative factors is a limitation. Fifth, the reward function is not adequately justified, and its impact on the Q-learning agent's behavior is not thoroughly analyzed. The reward function is defined as the change in validation loss divided by the current learning rate if the validation loss decreases, and -0.1 otherwise. While this reward function encourages validation loss reduction and learning rate stability, the authors do not provide a detailed explanation of the design choices or analyze how the reward function affects the agent's behavior. The ablation studies include variations in the reward signal, but a deeper theoretical analysis of the reward function's impact is missing. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as the reward function is defined and briefly justified, but a more detailed analysis is lacking. Finally, the paper lacks ablation studies on key components of the proposed approach, such as the state space and action space. While the paper includes ablation studies on the initial learning rate, reward signal, and epsilon decay, it does not explore the impact of different state and action space definitions. This lack of ablation studies makes it difficult to identify the most important factors contributing to the performance of the Q-learning algorithm. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as the paper does include some ablation studies, but not on all key components.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo significantly improve this paper, I recommend several concrete and actionable changes. First, the authors must clearly articulate the novelty of their approach by providing a comprehensive comparison with existing reinforcement learning-based methods for learning rate adaptation. This should include a detailed discussion of the papers provided by the reviewer (https://openreview.net/forum?id=5OUm5KMrJM and https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09799), highlighting the specific limitations of those methods and how the proposed Q-learning approach addresses those limitations. The authors should also discuss how their approach compares to other Q-learning based methods for learning rate adaptation. This will help to establish the paper's contribution and justify its publication. Second, the experimental evaluation needs to be significantly strengthened. The authors should evaluate their approach on a wider range of datasets and tasks, including image classification and sequence-to-sequence tasks. This will demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method. Furthermore, the authors should include comparisons with more advanced learning rate scheduling techniques, such as cosine annealing with warm-up, cyclical learning rates, and other adaptive methods. These comparisons should be performed on all datasets, and the results should be presented with clear statistical significance analysis. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the learning curves, highlighting the specific scenarios where the Q-learning approach outperforms the baselines. Third, the authors should provide a theoretical analysis of their Q-learning algorithm, including proofs of convergence and stability. This will provide a deeper understanding of the algorithm's behavior and its limitations. Fourth, the authors should consider expanding the state space to include other potentially informative factors, such as training loss, gradient norms, or model parameters. This could lead to a more robust and effective learning rate adaptation. The authors should also justify their choice of state space and discuss the potential impact of different state representations. Fifth, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of their reward function and its design choices. They should also analyze how the reward function affects the Q-learning agent's behavior and performance. This analysis should include a discussion of the potential limitations of the current reward function and alternative reward functions that could be explored. Finally, the authors should include ablation studies on the state space and action space. This will help to identify the most important factors contributing to the performance of the Q-learning algorithm. These ablation studies should explore different state and action space definitions and analyze their impact on the final performance. By addressing these weaknesses, the authors can significantly improve the quality and impact of their work.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nAfter reviewing the paper, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the proposed approach. First, how does the proposed Q-learning approach compare to other reinforcement learning methods for learning rate adaptation, such as policy gradient methods or actor-critic algorithms, in terms of both performance and computational cost? The paper mentions that their approach differs from policy gradient methods but does not provide a detailed comparison. Second, what is the computational overhead of using the Q-learning agent during training compared to traditional learning rate schedules? The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with the Q-learning algorithm, and it would be important to understand the trade-offs between performance gains and computational expenses. Third, can the authors provide more details on the sensitivity of the method to different hyperparameter settings in the Q-learning algorithm, such as the learning rate for the Q-network, the discount factor, and the exploration strategy? The paper includes some ablation studies on epsilon decay, but a more comprehensive analysis of these hyperparameters is needed. Fourth, why did the authors choose to define the state space solely based on the validation loss, current learning rate, and training iteration? Have they considered incorporating other factors, such as training loss, gradient norms, or model parameters, and if so, what was the rationale for not including them? Fifth, can the authors provide a more detailed explanation of the reward function and its design choices? How does the reward function affect the Q-learning agent's behavior and performance, and what are the potential limitations of the current reward function? Finally, given that the results in Table 1 show that the Q-learning approach does not consistently outperform the baseline methods, can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of these results and explain why the Q-learning approach does not consistently outperform the baseline methods? These questions are aimed at clarifying key methodological choices and assumptions and at identifying areas for future research.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the reward function and its design choices. They should also analyze how the reward function affects the agent's behavior and performance.\n\nInconsistent and Incomplete Results: The results presented in the paper are inconsistent and incomplete. The authors should provide a more thorough analysis of their experimental results and address any inconsistencies or missing data. For example, the results in Table 1 show that the Q-learning approach does not consistently outperform the baseline methods. In some cases, the baseline methods achieve lower validation losses. The authors should provide a more detailed analysis of these results and explain why the Q-learning approach does not consistently outperform the baseline methods.\n\nLack of Ablation Studies: The paper does not include ablation studies to evaluate the impact of different components of the proposed approach.

The writing is poor, with some tables and figures not being referenced in the paper, such as Figure 4. Some tables and figures are not even mentioned in the appendix, such as Table 3. The lack of references to these elements makes it difficult to understand their relevance and how they support the claims made in the paper. The reader is left to guess the purpose of these tables and figures, which significantly hinders the paper's clarity and flow.\n\n2. The paper lacks comparisons with other baselines. The results presented in Table 1 are not convincing, as the final training loss and validation loss show little difference.

There are many papers on using RL to adjust learning rates, such as https://openreview.net/forum?id=5OUm5KMrJM and https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09799.

First, the authors must ensure that all tables and figures are properly referenced within the text, including the appendix. Each table and figure should be explicitly discussed, explaining its purpose and how it relates to the paper's claims. For example, when introducing Figure 4, the authors should explain what specific aspect of the results it is meant to illustrate and how those results support their conclusions. Similarly, Table 3 should be discussed in the context of the ablation study, detailing the specific variations being compared and the implications of the observed results. This will greatly improve the paper's readability and ensure that the reader can follow the authors' line of reasoning.\n\nSecond, the experimental section needs to be significantly strengthened by including comparisons with a wider range of baseline methods.

Specifically, they should compare their Q-learning approach against policy gradient methods, such as REINFORCE, and actor-critic methods, like A2C or PPO.

The authors should also consider reporting the variance in performance across multiple runs to ensure the robustness of the results.\n\nFinally, the paper needs a more detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the Q-learning agent. The authors should provide a breakdown of the computational cost associated with each component of the Q-learning algorithm, such as the forward and backward passes for the Q-network, the update of the Q-table, and the exploration process.

First, the paper suffers from a lack of novelty in its approach.

The related work section is limited and does not include specific references to other reinforcement learning-based methods for learning rate adaptation, such as those found in the papers provided by the reviewer (https://openreview.net/forum?id=5OUm5KMrJM and https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09799).

The authors evaluate their approach on only three datasets, all of which are language modeling tasks. This lack of diversity makes it difficult to generalize the findings to other types of tasks, such as image classification or sequence-to-sequence tasks. Furthermore, the paper does not include comparisons with more advanced learning rate scheduling techniques, such as cosine annealing with warm-up or cyclical learning rates. The absence of these comparisons makes it challenging to assess the true effectiveness of the proposed Q-learning approach. The results presented in Table 1 show that the Q-learning approach does not consistently outperform the baseline methods. In some cases, the baseline methods achieve lower validation losses, specifically on the shakespeare_char dataset. This inconsistency undermines the paper's claim of superior performance. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the limited dataset diversity and the lack of comparisons with advanced baselines are clearly visible in the experimental section. Third, the paper lacks a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach. The authors do not provide any mathematical proofs or analysis of the convergence or stability properties of their Q-learning algorithm. This absence of theoretical grounding makes it difficult to understand the behavior of the algorithm and its limitations. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not include any theoretical analysis section. Fourth, the state space is defined solely based on the validation loss, current learning rate, and training iteration. While the inclusion of the training iteration is a positive aspect, the state space could be more comprehensive by incorporating other factors, such as training loss, gradient norms, or model parameters. These additional factors could provide a richer representation of the training dynamics and potentially lead to more robust and effective learning rate adaptation. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as the state space does include the training iteration, but the lack of other potentially informative factors is a limitation. Fifth, the reward function is not adequately justified, and its impact on the Q-learning agent's behavior is not thoroughly analyzed. The reward function is defined as the change in validation loss divided by the current learning rate if the validation loss decreases, and -0.1 otherwise. While this reward function encourages validation loss reduction and learning rate stability, the authors do not provide a detailed explanation of the design choices or analyze how the reward function affects the agent's behavior. The ablation studies include variations in the reward signal, but a deeper theoretical analysis of the reward function's impact is missing. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as the reward function is defined and briefly justified, but a more detailed analysis is lacking. Finally, the paper lacks ablation studies on key components of the proposed approach, such as the state space and action space. While the paper includes ablation studies on the initial learning rate, reward signal, and epsilon decay, it does not explore the impact of different state and action space definitions. This lack of ablation studies makes it difficult to identify the most important factors contributing to the performance of the Q-learning algorithm. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as the paper does include some ablation studies, but not on all key components.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo significantly improve this paper, I recommend several concrete and actionable changes. First, the authors must clearly articulate the novelty of their approach by providing a comprehensive comparison with existing reinforcement learning-based methods for learning rate adaptation. This should include a detailed discussion of the papers provided by the reviewer (https://openreview.net/forum?id=5OUm5KMrJM and https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09799), highlighting the specific limitations of those methods and how the proposed Q-learning approach addresses those limitations. The authors should also discuss how their approach compares to other Q-learning based methods for learning rate adaptation. This will help to establish the paper's contribution and justify its publication. Second, the experimental evaluation needs to be significantly strengthened. The authors should evaluate their approach on a wider range of datasets and tasks, including image classification and sequence-to-sequence tasks. This will demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method. Furthermore, the authors should include comparisons with more advanced learning rate scheduling techniques, such as cosine annealing with warm-up, cyclical learning rates, and other adaptive methods. These comparisons should be performed on all datasets, and the results should be presented with clear statistical significance analysis. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the learning curves, highlighting the specific scenarios where the Q-learning approach outperforms the baselines. Third, the authors should provide a theoretical analysis of their Q-learning algorithm, including proofs of convergence and stability. This will provide a deeper understanding of the algorithm's behavior and its limitations. Fourth, the authors should consider expanding the state space to include other potentially informative factors, such as training loss, gradient norms, or model parameters. This could lead to a more robust and effective learning rate adaptation. The authors should also justify their choice of state space and discuss the potential impact of different state representations. Fifth, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of their reward function and its design choices. They should also analyze how the reward function affects the Q-learning agent's behavior and performance. This analysis should include a discussion of the potential limitations of the current reward function and alternative reward functions that could be explored. Finally, the authors should include ablation studies on the state space and action space. This will help to identify the most important factors contributing to the performance of the Q-learning algorithm. These ablation studies should explore different state and action space definitions and analyze their impact on the final performance. By addressing these weaknesses, the authors can significantly improve the quality and impact of their work.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nAfter reviewing the paper, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the proposed approach. First, how does the proposed Q-learning approach compare to other reinforcement learning methods for learning rate adaptation, such as policy gradient methods or actor-critic algorithms, in terms of both performance and computational cost? The paper mentions that their approach differs from policy gradient methods but does not provide a detailed comparison. Second, what is the computational overhead of using the Q-learning agent during training compared to traditional learning rate schedules? The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with the Q-learning algorithm, and it would be important to understand the trade-offs between performance gains and computational expenses. Third, can the authors provide more details on the sensitivity of the method to different hyperparameter settings in the Q-learning algorithm, such as the learning rate for the Q-network, the discount factor, and the exploration strategy? The paper includes some ablation studies on epsilon decay, but a more comprehensive analysis of these hyperparameters is needed. Fourth, why did the authors choose to define the state space solely based on the validation loss, current learning rate, and training iteration? Have they considered incorporating other factors, such as training loss, gradient norms, or model parameters, and if so, what was the rationale for not including them? Fifth, can the authors provide a more detailed explanation of the reward function and its design choices? How does the reward function affect the Q-learning agent's behavior and performance, and what are the potential limitations of the current reward function? Finally, given that the results in Table 1 show that the Q-learning approach does not consistently outperform the baseline methods, can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of these results and explain why the Q-learning approach does not consistently outperform the baseline methods? These questions are aimed at clarifying key methodological choices and assumptions and at identifying areas for future research.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",
                "summary": "This paper introduces a Q-learning based approach for dynamically adjusting the learning rate during the training of transformer models, aiming to enhance training efficiency and model performance. The core idea is to treat the learning rate adaptation as a reinforcement learning problem, where the state is defined by the current validation loss, learning rate, and training iteration, and the action is the adjustment to the learning rate. The reward function is designed to encourage both a reduction in validation loss and stability in the learning rate. The authors evaluate their approach on three language modeling datasets: shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8, comparing the Q-learning method against static and heuristic-based learning rate schedules. The empirical results, presented in Table 1, show that the Q-learning approach achieves comparable or slightly better validation losses in some cases, but not consistently across all datasets. Specifically, while the Q-learning method shows a marginal improvement on enwik8 and text8, it performs slightly worse on shakespeare_char compared to the baseline. The paper also includes ablation studies that explore the impact of different initial learning rates, reward signals, and epsilon decay strategies on the performance of the Q-learning agent. While the paper presents an interesting application of reinforcement learning to learning rate adaptation, the lack of a comprehensive comparison with other RL-based methods, the limited experimental evaluation, and the absence of a theoretical analysis raise concerns about the overall significance and generalizability of the proposed approach. The paper's claim of consistent outperformance by the Q-learning method is not fully supported by the empirical results, and the lack of ablation studies on key components like the state and action space further limits the insights gained from this work. Overall, while the paper explores a promising direction, it requires further refinement and more rigorous evaluation to establish its contribution to the field.",

This is a timely and relevant problem, as the selection of an appropriate learning rate schedule is crucial for efficient and effective training of deep learning models. The paper's approach of framing learning rate adjustment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and using Q-learning to learn an optimal policy is a creative and potentially valuable contribution. The authors clearly define the state space, action space, and reward function, providing a concrete implementation of their proposed method. Furthermore, the paper includes ablation studies that investigate the impact of different initial learning rates, reward signals, and epsilon decay strategies on the performance of the Q-learning agent. These ablation studies, while not comprehensive, offer some insights into the sensitivity of the method to different hyperparameter settings. The paper also provides a clear description of the experimental setup, including the datasets used and the baseline methods compared against. The use of three different datasets, albeit all language modeling tasks, provides some evidence of the method's applicability across different data distributions. Finally, the paper's focus on a model-free RL algorithm like Q-learning, which does not require a differentiable reward signal, is a practical advantage over policy gradient methods, making it potentially more accessible for a wider range of applications.

The authors incorporate learnable style embeddings and a style classification head into a GPT architecture, using a StyleAdapter module to modulate hidden states. The approach is evaluated on three datasets: shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8, achieving high style consistency scores and competitive language modeling performance. The proposed method demonstrates a trade-off between improved style consistency and reduced inference speed.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n2\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n* The Multi-Style Adapter effectively enhances style consistency across different datasets, achieving near-perfect style consistency scores.\n* The approach maintains competitive language modeling performance, with improved validation losses compared to the baseline.\n* The model demonstrates the ability to balance style adaptation with language modeling capabilities, which is crucial for diverse applications in text generation.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n * The Multi-Style Adapter approach assumes a predefined and finite set of styles, which may limit its applicability to scenarios with more fluid or dynamic stylistic variations. The model's reliance on a fixed set of style embeddings means it cannot adapt to novel styles not encountered during training, potentially hindering its performance in real-world scenarios where stylistic diversity is common.\n* The approach results in a significant reduction in inference speed, approximately 40% slower than the baseline, which could be a critical issue for real-time applications. This slowdown is a practical concern, as it impacts the usability of the model in time-sensitive applications. The authors should have explored optimization techniques to mitigate this performance hit.\n* The paper acknowledges the risk of overfitting, particularly given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets, which may indicate limited flexibility in generating diverse text within each style. The perfect consistency scores, while seemingly positive, raise concerns about the model's ability to generalize and produce varied outputs within a given style. This could be a result of the model memorizing training data rather than learning generalizable style patterns.\n* The Multi-Style Adapter increases computational complexity, leading to slower inference speeds and higher resource consumption, which may limit its scalability for larger models or datasets. The increased computational demands of the adapter module could make it difficult to deploy the model on resource-constrained devices or with large-scale datasets, limiting its practical applicability.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe authors should investigate methods to extend the Multi-Style Adapter to handle a more continuous or high-dimensional space of styles, rather than relying on a fixed set of embeddings. This could involve exploring techniques such as style embeddings derived from a separate encoder network that takes style descriptors as input, allowing the model to adapt to novel styles not seen during training. Another approach could be to use a variational approach to model style, allowing for the generation of diverse styles within a continuous space. This would address the limitation of the current approach in handling dynamic and diverse stylistic variations.\n\nTo address the significant reduction in inference speed, the authors should explore optimization techniques such as model quantization, pruning, or knowledge distillation. These techniques could help reduce the computational overhead of the Multi-Style Adapter without significantly compromising its performance. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the possibility of using a more efficient architecture for the style adapter module, such as a lightweight neural network or a sparse attention mechanism. These optimizations are crucial for making the model practical for real-time applications and for reducing its resource consumption.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of overfitting and improve the diversity of generated text, the authors should explore techniques such as adding noise to the style embeddings during training or using a style diversity loss term. This would encourage the model to explore a wider range of stylistic variations within each style category. Additionally, the authors should evaluate the model on larger and more diverse datasets to assess its generalization capabilities. The use of metrics that specifically measure the diversity of generated text, such as the self-BLEU score, would also be beneficial in evaluating the model's ability to generate varied outputs.\n\n### Questions\n\n* How sensitive is the model’s performance to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the weight of the style loss (λ) and the frequency of StyleAdapter application?\n* How does the Multi-Style Adapter perform when dealing with styles that are very similar to each other? Is there a risk of style confusion, and if so, how can it be mitigated?\n* Can the Multi-Style Adapter be effectively applied to larger language models, such as those with billions of parameters, and how would the performance and computational trade-offs scale?\n* How does the model handle cases where the desired style might evolve or change over the course of the generated text? Is there a mechanism to allow for dynamic style shifts within a single sequence?\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper presents a Multi-Style Adapter for character-level language models, aiming to enhance style awareness and consistency in generated text.

This reliance on a fixed set of style embeddings could hinder the model's ability to generalize to unseen styles or adapt to nuanced stylistic shifts within a single genre.\n\nThe approach results in a significant reduction in inference speed, approximately 40% slower than the baseline, which could be a critical issue for real-time applications. This slowdown, while acknowledged, is a substantial drawback that needs to be addressed for practical deployment.\n\nThe paper acknowledges the risk of overfitting, particularly given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets, which may indicate limited flexibility in generating diverse text within each style. This raises concerns about the model's ability to generate truly varied outputs, potentially leading to repetitive or formulaic text.\n\nThe Multi-Style Adapter increases computational complexity, leading to slower inference speeds and higher resource consumption, which may limit its scalability for larger models or datasets. The added complexity could make the model less practical for resource-constrained environments or large-scale applications.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo address the limitation of a predefined style set, future work should explore methods for handling a continuous style space. This could involve techniques such as learning a style embedding from a descriptive text or using a variational approach to sample styles from a distribution. Such methods would allow the model to generalize to unseen styles and adapt to more nuanced stylistic variations. For example, instead of relying on fixed embeddings, the model could learn a mapping from style descriptors to style embeddings, enabling it to handle a wider range of stylistic inputs. This would significantly enhance the model's flexibility and applicability in real-world scenarios where styles are not always clearly defined or categorized.\n\nTo mitigate the significant reduction in inference speed, several optimization strategies should be investigated. Techniques such as model quantization, which reduces the precision of the model's weights, or pruning, which removes less important connections, could be explored to reduce the computational overhead. Additionally, the StyleAdapter module could be redesigned to be more computationally efficient, perhaps by using a lighter architecture or by incorporating techniques like knowledge distillation to transfer the knowledge of a larger, more accurate model to a smaller, faster one. These optimizations are crucial for making the model practical for real-time applications and for reducing its resource consumption. Furthermore, exploring alternative inference strategies, such as caching intermediate results, could also help improve the overall speed.\n\nTo address the risk of overfitting and improve the diversity of generated text, several techniques should be considered. Firstly, regularization methods, such as dropout or weight decay, could be applied more aggressively to prevent the model from memorizing the training data. Secondly, the training data could be augmented with style-mixed data to encourage the model to learn more robust style representations. Finally, techniques such as nucleus sampling or temperature scaling could be used during inference to encourage the model to generate more diverse outputs. These methods would help to ensure that the model can generate a wider range of stylistically consistent text, rather than falling into repetitive patterns.\n\n### Questions\n\nHow sensitive is the model’s performance to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the weight of the style loss (λ) and the frequency of StyleAdapter application?\n\nHow does the Multi-Style Adapter perform when dealing with styles that are very similar to each other?

The authors propose a method that integrates learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and a StyleAdapter module within the GPT architecture. The approach aims to maintain style consistency while preserving the language generation capabilities of the model. The authors conduct experiments on three datasets: shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8, demonstrating that their method achieves high style consistency with competitive language modeling performance. However, the approach results in a trade-off with computational efficiency, leading to slower inference speeds.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n2\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper introduces a novel Multi-Style Adapter architecture that addresses the challenge of maintaining style consistency in language generation.\n2. The method effectively balances style adaptation and language modeling capabilities, achieving high style consistency scores across multiple datasets.\n3. The paper provides a comprehensive experimental evaluation, including ablation studies and comparisons with baseline models, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the Multi-Style Adapter. While the authors acknowledge a reduction in inference speed, they do not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with the style classification and adaptation modules. Specifically, the paper does not quantify the increase in FLOPs or parameter count due to the added modules, making it difficult to assess the true computational impact. A more granular analysis, perhaps including a breakdown of the time spent in each module during inference, would be beneficial.\n2. The paper does not adequately address the potential for overfitting, especially given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets. The authors should investigate the model's generalization capabilities on unseen data and explore techniques to mitigate overfitting, such as regularization or data augmentation. The perfect consistency scores, while seemingly positive, raise concerns that the model may be memorizing style patterns rather than learning generalizable style representations. This is particularly concerning if the style classifier is also trained on the same data, as it could lead to a feedback loop that reinforces memorization.\n3. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the trade-off between style consistency and diversity in the generated text. The current evaluation focuses primarily on consistency, but it is equally important to ensure that the model can generate diverse and creative text within each style. The paper should include metrics that quantify the diversity of the generated text, such as n-gram diversity or self-BLEU scores, and explore how the model's parameters affect this trade-off. It is crucial to understand if the model sacrifices diversity for the sake of consistency.\n4. The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art style-aware language models. While the authors compare their approach to a baseline model, they do not benchmark against other existing methods that address similar challenges. A more thorough comparison with models that use different techniques for style control would provide a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach. This comparison should include not only performance metrics but also computational costs and architectural differences.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo address the lack of computational analysis, the authors should provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with the Multi-Style Adapter. This should include a quantification of the increase in FLOPs, parameter count, and memory usage due to the added style classification and adaptation modules. Furthermore, the authors should analyze the inference time of each module separately to pinpoint the bottlenecks in the architecture. This analysis should be performed on all datasets used in the paper to ensure consistency. It would also be beneficial to compare the computational overhead of the proposed method with other style-aware language models to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its efficiency. The authors should also explore techniques to optimize the computational efficiency of the Multi-Style Adapter, such as model compression or quantization, to mitigate the observed slowdown in inference speed. This would make the proposed method more practical for real-world applications.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of overfitting, the authors should conduct a more rigorous evaluation of the model's generalization capabilities on unseen data. This could involve training the model on a subset of the data and evaluating its performance on a held-out set. Additionally, the authors should explore regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, to prevent the model from memorizing the training data. Data augmentation techniques, such as introducing noise or variations in the training data, could also be used to improve the model's robustness. The authors should also investigate the impact of the style loss weight on the model's generalization performance and provide guidelines for selecting an appropriate value. It is crucial to ensure that the model learns generalizable style representations rather than memorizing style patterns in the training data.

The approach incorporates learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and a StyleAdapter module within the GPT architecture. The model is evaluated on three datasets: shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8, demonstrating high style consistency and competitive language modeling performance. However, it comes at the cost of increased computational complexity and slower inference speeds.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n2\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper introduces a novel Multi-Style Adapter architecture that allows for fine-grained stylistic control in text generation, which is a significant advancement in the field of style-aware language modeling.\n2. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high style consistency across multiple datasets, with near-perfect style consistency scores, indicating its effectiveness in maintaining consistent styles throughout generated text.\n3. The approach maintains competitive language modeling performance, with improved validation losses compared to the baseline, demonstrating that the Multi-Style Adapter effectively balances style adaptation and language modeling capabilities.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the Multi-Style Adapter. While the authors acknowledge a reduction in inference speed, they do not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with the style classification and adaptation modules. Specifically, the paper does not quantify the increase in FLOPs or parameter count due to the added modules, making it difficult to assess the true computational impact. A more granular analysis, perhaps including a breakdown of the time spent in each module during inference, would be beneficial.\n2. The paper does not adequately address the potential for overfitting, especially given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets. The authors should investigate the model's generalization capabilities on unseen data and explore techniques to mitigate overfitting, such as regularization or data augmentation. The perfect consistency scores, while seemingly positive, raise concerns that the model may be memorizing style patterns rather than learning generalizable style representations. This is particularly concerning if the style classifier is also trained on the same data, as it could lead to a feedback loop that reinforces memorization.\n3. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the trade-off between style consistency and diversity in the generated text. The current evaluation focuses primarily on consistency, but it is equally important to ensure that the model can generate diverse and creative text within each style. The paper should include metrics that quantify the diversity of the generated text, such as n-gram diversity or self-BLEU scores, and explore how the model's parameters affect this trade-off. It is crucial to understand if the model sacrifices diversity for the sake of consistency.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo address the lack of computational analysis, the authors should provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with the Multi-Style Adapter. This should include a quantification of the increase in FLOPs, parameter count, and memory usage due to the added style classification and adaptation modules. Furthermore, the authors should analyze the inference time of each module separately to pinpoint the bottlenecks in the architecture. This analysis should be performed on all datasets used in the paper to ensure consistency. It would also be beneficial to compare the computational overhead of the proposed method with other style-aware language models to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its efficiency. The authors should also explore techniques to optimize the computational efficiency of the Multi-Style Adapter, such as model compression or quantization, to mitigate the observed slowdown in inference speed. This would make the proposed method more practical for real-world applications.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of overfitting, the authors should conduct a more rigorous evaluation of the model's generalization capabilities on unseen data. This could involve training the model on a subset of the data and evaluating its performance on a held-out set. Additionally, the authors should explore regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, to prevent the model from memorizing the training data. Data augmentation techniques, such as introducing noise or variations in the training data, could also be used to improve the model's robustness. The authors should also investigate the impact of the style loss weight on the model's generalization performance and provide guidelines for selecting an appropriate value. It is crucial to ensure that the model learns generalizable style representations rather than memorizing style patterns in the training data. The authors should also consider using a separate dataset for training the style classifier to avoid potential bias.\n\nTo address the trade-off between style consistency and diversity, the authors should include metrics that quantify the diversity of the generated text, such as n-gram diversity or self-BLEU scores.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces the Multi-Style Adapter, a novel approach designed to enhance style awareness and consistency in character-level language models. The core contribution lies in the integration of learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and a StyleAdapter module within the GPT architecture. This architecture aims to modulate the hidden states of the language model based on the inferred style, thereby achieving fine-grained stylistic control during text generation. The method is evaluated on three datasets: shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8, demonstrating high style consistency and competitive language modeling performance. The authors report near-perfect style consistency scores across all datasets, along with improved validation losses compared to a baseline GPT model. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased computational complexity, leading to slower inference speeds. The paper's significance lies in its attempt to address the challenge of maintaining style consistency in generated text, a crucial aspect for various applications in natural language generation. The proposed Multi-Style Adapter offers a mechanism to incorporate stylistic information into the generation process, potentially enabling more controllable and diverse text generation. The approach involves defining a fixed set of style embeddings, which are learned during training. A style classification head is used to infer the style of the input sequence, and the StyleAdapter module modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high style consistency, with scores reaching 1.0 on the enwik8 and text8 datasets. The authors also report improved validation losses, indicating that the Multi-Style Adapter does not significantly degrade the language modeling performance. However, the paper also acknowledges a reduction in inference speed, with the Multi-Style Adapter being approximately 40% slower than the baseline. Additionally, the paper raises concerns about the potential for overfitting, particularly given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets. The authors also note the increased computational complexity of the proposed method, with higher parameter counts, FLOPs per token, and memory usage compared to the baseline. Despite these limitations, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of style-aware language modeling, offering a novel approach to incorporate stylistic information into the generation process. The method's ability to achieve high style consistency while maintaining competitive language modeling performance makes it a promising direction for future research. However, the identified weaknesses, such as the reliance on a predefined set of styles, the reduction in inference speed, and the potential for overfitting, need to be addressed to make the approach more practical and robust. The paper's exploration of the trade-offs between style consistency and computational efficiency provides valuable insights for future work in this area. Overall, the paper presents a significant step towards more controllable and diverse text generation, but further research is needed to overcome the identified limitations.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe primary strength of this paper lies in its introduction of the Multi-Style Adapter, a novel architecture designed to enhance style awareness and consistency in character-level language models. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it addresses the challenging problem of maintaining stylistic coherence in generated text. The proposed method effectively integrates learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and a StyleAdapter module within the GPT architecture, allowing for fine-grained control over the style of generated text. This approach represents a technical innovation in the way stylistic information is incorporated into the language generation process. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Multi-Style Adapter in achieving high style consistency across multiple datasets. The authors report near-perfect style consistency scores, with values reaching 1.0 on the enwik8 and text8 datasets, indicating that the model can effectively maintain the desired style throughout the generated text. This is a significant achievement, as it shows that the proposed method can successfully control the style of the generated output. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that the Multi-Style Adapter maintains competitive language modeling performance, with improved validation losses compared to the baseline GPT model. This is an important finding, as it shows that the incorporation of stylistic information does not significantly degrade the model's ability to generate coherent and fluent text. The authors report a slight improvement in validation loss, indicating that the Multi-Style Adapter can enhance both style consistency and language modeling capabilities. The ablation studies and comparisons with baseline models further support the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with the Multi-Style Adapter, including parameter counts, FLOPs per token, and memory usage. This analysis is valuable for understanding the computational overhead of the proposed method and for comparing it with other approaches. The paper also includes a comparison with three state-of-the-art style-aware language models, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance. This comparison demonstrates that the Multi-Style Adapter achieves competitive performance compared to existing methods. The paper's focus on character-level language models is also a strength, as it allows for a more fine-grained control over the generated text. This is particularly important for applications where stylistic variations are subtle and require precise control. Overall, the paper presents a well-designed and thoroughly evaluated approach to style-aware language modeling, making a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile the paper presents a novel approach to style-aware language modeling, several weaknesses limit its applicability and impact. A primary concern is the reliance on a predefined and finite set of styles. As explicitly stated in the method section, the model uses a fixed number of learnable style embeddings, with K=4 representing the number of predefined styles. This assumption limits the model's ability to handle novel or dynamic styles not encountered during training, hindering its performance in real-world scenarios where stylistic diversity is common. The model's reliance on a fixed set of style embeddings means it cannot adapt to styles outside this predefined set, which is a significant limitation. This is a high-confidence issue, directly supported by the method's description. Another significant weakness is the substantial reduction in inference speed. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the Multi-Style Adapter is approximately 40% slower than the baseline GPT model across all datasets. For instance, the inference speed for shakespeare_char drops from 666.51 tokens/s (baseline) to 411.93 tokens/s (Multi-Style Adapter). This slowdown is a practical concern, impacting the usability of the model in time-sensitive applications. While the authors acknowledge this reduction, they do not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with the style classification and adaptation modules, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact sources of the slowdown. This is a high-confidence issue, supported by the reported inference speed values. The paper also acknowledges the risk of overfitting, particularly given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets. The style consistency scores for enwik8 and text8 are reported as 1.0, which raises concerns that the model may be memorizing style patterns rather than learning generalizable style representations. This is a high-confidence issue, supported by the reported style consistency scores. The perfect consistency scores, while seemingly positive, suggest a lack of diversity in the generated text, potentially leading to repetitive or formulaic outputs. This is a significant limitation, as it undermines the model's ability to generate varied and creative text within each style. The increased computational complexity of the Multi-Style Adapter is another significant weakness. The paper reports an increase in parameters from 124M (baseline) to 127M (Ours), an increase in FLOPs per token from 1.2G to 1.3G, and an increase in memory usage from 4.8GB to 5.1GB. This added complexity leads to slower inference speeds and higher resource consumption, which may limit its scalability for larger models or datasets. This is a high-confidence issue, supported by the reported computational metrics. The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the Multi-Style Adapter. While the authors acknowledge a reduction in inference speed, they do not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with the style classification and adaptation modules. Specifically, the paper does not quantify the increase in FLOPs or parameter count due to the added modules, making it difficult to assess the true computational impact. A more granular analysis, perhaps including a breakdown of the time spent in each module during inference, would be beneficial. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper provides overall parameter and FLOPs counts but lacks a detailed breakdown per module. The paper does not adequately address the potential for overfitting, especially given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets. The authors should investigate the model's generalization capabilities on unseen data and explore techniques to mitigate overfitting, such as regularization or data augmentation. The perfect consistency scores, while seemingly positive, raise concerns that the model may be memorizing style patterns rather than learning generalizable style representations. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper lacks explicit investigation into generalization or mitigation techniques. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the trade-off between style consistency and diversity in the generated text. The current evaluation focuses primarily on consistency, but it is equally important to ensure that the model can generate diverse and creative text within each style. The paper should include metrics that quantify the diversity of the generated text, such as n-gram diversity or self-BLEU scores, and explore how the model's parameters affect this trade-off. It is crucial to understand if the model sacrifices diversity for the sake of consistency. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper explicitly lists evaluation metrics, which does not include diversity metrics. The paper also lacks a sensitivity analysis of the model's performance to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the weight of the style loss (λ) and the frequency of StyleAdapter application. The paper mentions the specific values used for these hyperparameters but lacks a sensitivity analysis. Without a sensitivity analysis, it's unclear how performance varies with these hyperparameters. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper states the fixed values used for the style loss weight and StyleAdapter application frequency without exploring their impact through sensitivity analysis. The paper does not explicitly evaluate the model's performance on very similar styles. The experimental setup does not include scenarios with highly similar styles to assess potential confusion. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper lacks experiments or discussion on style confusion with similar styles. The paper uses a relatively small model and does not discuss scaling to larger models. The paper describes a model with a limited number of layers and does not provide analysis or experiments on larger models. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper describes a model with a limited number of layers and does not provide analysis or experiments on larger models. Finally, the paper focuses on character-level language models and does not discuss the application to word-level or subword-level models. The paper's explicit focus on character-level language models indicates that the applicability to other levels is not explored. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper explicitly focuses on character-level models.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, several concrete improvements can be made. First, to overcome the limitation of a predefined style set, future work should explore methods for handling a continuous style space. This could involve techniques such as learning a style embedding from a descriptive text or using a variational approach to sample styles from a distribution. Such methods would allow the model to generalize to unseen styles and adapt to more nuanced stylistic variations. For example, instead of relying on fixed embeddings, the model could learn a mapping from style descriptors to style embeddings, enabling it to handle a wider range of stylistic inputs. This would significantly enhance the model's flexibility and applicability in real-world scenarios where styles are not always clearly defined or categorized. Furthermore, the model could be trained on a dataset of style descriptions, allowing it to learn a more diverse set of styles. This would enable the model to generate text in a wider range of styles, making it more versatile and useful in a variety of applications. To mitigate the significant reduction in inference speed, several optimization strategies should be investigated. Techniques such as model quantization, which reduces the precision of the model's weights, or pruning, which removes less important connections, could be explored to reduce the computational overhead of the Multi-Style Adapter without significantly compromising its performance. Additionally, the StyleAdapter module could be redesigned to be more computationally efficient, perhaps by using a lighter architecture or by incorporating techniques like knowledge distillation to transfer the knowledge of a larger, more accurate model to a smaller, faster one. These optimizations are crucial for making the model practical for real-time applications and for reducing its resource consumption. Furthermore, exploring alternative inference strategies, such as caching intermediate results, could also help improve the overall speed. To address the risk of overfitting and improve the diversity of generated text, several techniques should be considered. Firstly, regularization methods, such as dropout or weight decay, could be applied more aggressively to prevent the model from memorizing the training data. Secondly, the training data could be augmented with style-mixed data to encourage the model to learn more robust style representations. Finally, techniques such as nucleus sampling or temperature scaling could be used during inference to encourage the model to generate more diverse outputs. These methods would help to ensure that the model can generate a wider range of stylistically consistent text, rather than falling into repetitive patterns. The authors should also explore techniques to balance style consistency with diversity, such as introducing randomness in the style adaptation process or using a diversity-promoting loss function. It is important to ensure that the model can generate diverse and creative text within each style while maintaining consistency. The authors should also provide a qualitative analysis of the generated text to assess its diversity and creativity. This analysis should include examples of generated text that demonstrate both high consistency and high diversity. To provide a more thorough analysis of the computational overhead, the authors should quantify the increase in FLOPs, parameter count, and memory usage due to the added style classification and adaptation modules. Furthermore, the authors should analyze the inference time of each module separately to pinpoint the bottlenecks in the architecture. This analysis should be performed on all datasets used in the paper to ensure consistency. It would also be beneficial to compare the computational overhead of the proposed method with other style-aware language models to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its efficiency. The authors should also explore techniques to optimize the computational efficiency of the Multi-Style Adapter, such as model compression or quantization, to mitigate the observed slowdown in inference speed. This would make the proposed method more practical for real-world applications. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, the authors should conduct a more rigorous evaluation of the model's generalization capabilities on unseen data. This could involve training the model on a subset of the data and evaluating its performance on a held-out set. Additionally, the authors should explore regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, to prevent the model from memorizing the training data. Data augmentation techniques, such as introducing noise or variations in the training data, could also be used to improve the model's robustness. The authors should also investigate the impact of the style loss weight on the model's generalization performance and provide guidelines for selecting an appropriate value. It is crucial to ensure that the model learns generalizable style representations rather than memorizing style patterns in the training data. The authors should also consider using a separate dataset for training the style classifier to avoid potential bias. To address the trade-off between style consistency and diversity, the authors should include metrics that quantify the diversity of the generated text, such as n-gram diversity or self-BLEU scores. They should also explore how the model's parameters, such as the style loss weight and the frequency of StyleAdapter application, affect this trade-off. The authors should investigate techniques to balance style consistency with diversity, such as introducing randomness in the style adaptation process or using a diversity-promoting loss function. It is important to ensure that the model can generate diverse and creative text within each style while maintaining consistency. The authors should also provide a qualitative analysis of the generated text to assess its diversity and creativity. This analysis should include examples of generated text that demonstrate both high consistency and high diversity. Finally, the authors should conduct a sensitivity analysis of the model's performance to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the weight of the style loss (λ) and the frequency of StyleAdapter application. This analysis should explore how the model's performance varies with different values of these hyperparameters. The authors should also evaluate the model's performance on datasets with very similar styles to assess the risk of style confusion. Furthermore, the authors should explore the scalability of the approach to larger language models and discuss the potential modifications that would be necessary to apply the Multi-Style Adapter to other language model architectures beyond GPT. The authors should also discuss the potential adjustments required to apply the approach to word-level or subword-level models.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nSeveral key questions arise from my analysis of this paper. First, how does the Multi-Style Adapter approach scale with larger datasets and more complex language models? The paper uses a relatively small model with 6 transformer layers, and it's unclear how the approach would perform with models that have billions of parameters. Are there any limitations in terms of memory or computational requirements that would prevent the approach from scaling to larger models? Second, given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets, how can the risk of overfitting be mitigated, and what are the implications for the model's generalization capabilities? The paper acknowledges this risk, but it doesn't provide a detailed analysis of how the model would perform on unseen data or how to prevent the model from memorizing style patterns. What techniques could be used to improve the model's generalization capabilities and ensure that it learns robust style representations? Third, how does the model handle cases where the desired style might evolve or change over the course of the generated text? The paper mentions that the style classification head dynamically infers the style of the input sequence, but it's unclear how well the model handles rapid or complex style evolutions within a single sequence. Is there a mechanism to allow for dynamic style shifts within a single sequence, and how does the model ensure a smooth transition between different styles? Fourth, can the Multi-Style Adapter be effectively applied to other language model architectures beyond GPT, and what modifications would be necessary? The paper focuses on the GPT architecture, but it's unclear how the approach would generalize to other architectures, such as encoder-decoder models or models with different attention mechanisms. What specific modifications would be required to adapt the Multi-Style Adapter to other architectures, and how would these modifications affect the model's performance? Fifth, the paper focuses on character-level language models. How would the approach perform on word-level or subword-level models, and what adjustments would be required? The paper does not discuss the application to word-level or subword-level models, and it's unclear how the approach would need to be modified to work with these different levels of granularity. What are the potential challenges and opportunities of applying the Multi-Style Adapter to word-level or subword-level models? Finally, how sensitive is the model’s performance to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the weight of the style loss (λ) and the frequency of StyleAdapter application? The paper mentions the specific values used for these hyperparameters but lacks a sensitivity analysis. How does the model's performance vary with different values of these hyperparameters, and what are the optimal values for achieving a balance between style consistency and language modeling performance? These questions highlight key uncertainties and areas for future research, focusing on the core methodological choices and assumptions of the paper. Addressing these questions would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of the Multi-Style Adapter and would help to guide future research in this area.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.75\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces the Multi-Style Adapter, a novel approach designed to enhance style awareness and consistency in character-level language models. The core contribution lies in the integration of learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and a StyleAdapter module within the GPT architecture. This architecture aims to modulate the hidden states of the language model based on the inferred style, thereby achieving fine-grained stylistic control during text generation. The method is evaluated on three datasets: shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8, demonstrating high style consistency and competitive language modeling performance. The authors report near-perfect style consistency scores across all datasets, along with improved validation losses compared to a baseline GPT model. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased computational complexity, leading to slower inference speeds. The paper's significance lies in its attempt to address the challenge of maintaining style consistency in generated text, a crucial aspect for various applications in natural language generation. The proposed Multi-Style Adapter offers a mechanism to incorporate stylistic information into the generation process, potentially enabling more controllable and diverse text generation. The approach involves defining a fixed set of style embeddings, which are learned during training. A style classification head is used to infer the style of the input sequence, and the StyleAdapter module modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high style consistency, with scores reaching 1.0 on the enwik8 and text8 datasets. The authors also report improved validation losses, indicating that the Multi-Style Adapter does not significantly degrade the language modeling performance. However, the paper also acknowledges a reduction in inference speed, with the Multi-Style Adapter being approximately 40% slower than the baseline. Additionally, the paper raises concerns about the potential for overfitting, particularly given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets. The authors also note the increased computational complexity of the proposed method, with higher parameter counts, FLOPs per token, and memory usage compared to the baseline. Despite these limitations, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of style-aware language modeling, offering a novel approach to incorporate stylistic information into the generation process. The method's ability to achieve high style consistency while maintaining competitive language modeling performance makes it a promising direction for future research. However, the identified weaknesses, such as the reliance on a predefined set of styles, the reduction in inference speed, and the potential for overfitting, need to be addressed to make the approach more practical and robust. The paper's exploration of the trade-offs between style consistency and computational efficiency provides valuable insights for future work in this area. Overall, the paper presents a significant step towards more controllable and diverse text generation, but further research is needed to overcome the identified limitations.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe primary strength of this paper lies in its introduction of the Multi-Style Adapter, a novel architecture designed to enhance style awareness and consistency in character-level language models. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it addresses the challenging problem of maintaining stylistic coherence in generated text. The proposed method effectively integrates learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and a StyleAdapter module within the GPT architecture, allowing for fine-grained control over the style of generated text. This approach represents a technical innovation in the way stylistic information is incorporated into the language generation process. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Multi-Style Adapter in achieving high style consistency across multiple datasets. The authors report near-perfect style consistency scores, with values reaching 1.0 on the enwik8 and text8 datasets, indicating that the model can effectively maintain the desired style throughout the generated text. This is a significant achievement, as it shows that the proposed method can successfully control the style of the generated output. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that the Multi-Style Adapter maintains competitive language modeling performance, with improved validation losses compared to the baseline GPT model. This is an important finding, as it shows that the incorporation of stylistic information does not significantly degrade the model's ability to generate coherent and fluent text. The authors report a slight improvement in validation loss, indicating that the Multi-Style Adapter can enhance both style consistency and language modeling capabilities. The ablation studies and comparisons with baseline models further support the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with the Multi-Style Adapter, including parameter counts, FLOPs per token, and memory usage. This analysis is valuable for understanding the computational overhead of the proposed method and for comparing it with other approaches. The paper also includes a comparison with three state-of-the-art style-aware language models, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance. This comparison demonstrates that the Multi-Style Adapter achieves competitive performance compared to existing methods. The paper's focus on character-level language models is also a strength, as it allows for a more fine-grained control over the generated text. This is particularly important for applications where stylistic variations are subtle and require precise control. Overall, the paper presents a well-designed and thoroughly evaluated approach to style-aware language modeling, making a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile the paper presents a novel approach to style-aware language modeling, several weaknesses limit its applicability and impact. A primary concern is the reliance on a predefined and finite set of styles. As explicitly stated in the method section, the model uses a fixed number of learnable style embeddings, with K=4 representing the number of predefined styles. This assumption limits the model's ability to handle novel or dynamic styles not encountered during training, hindering its performance in real-world scenarios where stylistic diversity is common. The model's reliance on a fixed set of style embeddings means it cannot adapt to styles outside this predefined set, which is a significant limitation. This is a high-confidence issue, directly supported by the method's description. Another significant weakness is the substantial reduction in inference speed. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the Multi-Style Adapter is approximately 40% slower than the baseline GPT model across all datasets. For instance, the inference speed for shakespeare_char drops from 666.51 tokens/s (baseline) to 411.93 tokens/s (Multi-Style Adapter). This slowdown is a practical concern, impacting the usability of the model in time-sensitive applications. While the authors acknowledge this reduction, they do not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with the style classification and adaptation modules, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact sources of the slowdown. This is a high-confidence issue, supported by the reported inference speed values. The paper also acknowledges the risk of overfitting, particularly given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets. The style consistency scores for enwik8 and text8 are reported as 1.0, which raises concerns that the model may be memorizing style patterns rather than learning generalizable style representations. This is a high-confidence issue, supported by the reported style consistency scores. The perfect consistency scores, while seemingly positive, suggest a lack of diversity in the generated text, potentially leading to repetitive or formulaic outputs. This is a significant limitation, as it undermines the model's ability to generate varied and creative text within each style. The increased computational complexity of the Multi-Style Adapter is another significant weakness. The paper reports an increase in parameters from 124M (baseline) to 127M (Ours), an increase in FLOPs per token from 1.2G to 1.3G, and an increase in memory usage from 4.8GB to 5.1GB. This added complexity leads to slower inference speeds and higher resource consumption, which may limit its scalability for larger models or datasets. This is a high-confidence issue, supported by the reported computational metrics. The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the Multi-Style Adapter. While the authors acknowledge a reduction in inference speed, they do not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with the style classification and adaptation modules. Specifically, the paper does not quantify the increase in FLOPs or parameter count due to the added modules, making it difficult to assess the true computational impact. A more granular analysis, perhaps including a breakdown of the time spent in each module during inference, would be beneficial. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper provides overall parameter and FLOPs counts but lacks a detailed breakdown per module. The paper does not adequately address the potential for overfitting, especially given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets. The authors should investigate the model's generalization capabilities on unseen data and explore techniques to mitigate overfitting, such as regularization or data augmentation. The perfect consistency scores, while seemingly positive, raise concerns that the model may be memorizing style patterns rather than learning generalizable style representations. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper lacks explicit investigation into generalization or mitigation techniques. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the trade-off between style consistency and diversity in the generated text. The current evaluation focuses primarily on consistency, but it is equally important to ensure that the model can generate diverse and creative text within each style. The paper should include metrics that quantify the diversity of the generated text, such as n-gram diversity or self-BLEU scores, and explore how the model's parameters affect this trade-off. It is crucial to understand if the model sacrifices diversity for the sake of consistency. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper explicitly lists evaluation metrics, which does not include diversity metrics. The paper also lacks a sensitivity analysis of the model's performance to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the weight of the style loss (λ) and the frequency of StyleAdapter application. The paper mentions the specific values used for these hyperparameters but lacks a sensitivity analysis. Without a sensitivity analysis, it's unclear how performance varies with these hyperparameters. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper states the fixed values used for the style loss weight and StyleAdapter application frequency without exploring their impact through sensitivity analysis. The paper does not explicitly evaluate the model's performance on very similar styles. The experimental setup does not include scenarios with highly similar styles to assess potential confusion. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper lacks experiments or discussion on style confusion with similar styles. The paper uses a relatively small model and does not discuss scaling to larger models. The paper describes a model with a limited number of layers and does not provide analysis or experiments on larger models. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper describes a model with a limited number of layers and does not provide analysis or experiments on larger models. Finally, the paper focuses on character-level language models and does not discuss the application to word-level or subword-level models. The paper's explicit focus on character-level language models indicates that the applicability to other levels is not explored. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper explicitly focuses on character-level models.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, several concrete improvements can be made. First, to overcome the limitation of a predefined style set, future work should explore methods for handling a continuous style space. This could involve techniques such as learning a style embedding from a descriptive text or using a variational approach to sample styles from a distribution. Such methods would allow the model to generalize to unseen styles and adapt to more nuanced stylistic variations. For example, instead of relying on fixed embeddings, the model could learn a mapping from style descriptors to style embeddings, enabling it to handle a wider range of stylistic inputs. This would significantly enhance the model's flexibility and applicability in real-world scenarios where styles are not always clearly defined or categorized. Furthermore, the model could be trained on a dataset of style descriptions, allowing it to learn a more diverse set of styles. This would enable the model to generate text in a wider range of styles, making it more versatile and useful in a variety of applications. To mitigate the significant reduction in inference speed, several optimization strategies should be investigated. Techniques such as model quantization, which reduces the precision of the model's weights, or pruning, which removes less important connections, could be explored to reduce the computational overhead of the Multi-Style Adapter without significantly compromising its performance. Additionally, the StyleAdapter module could be redesigned to be more computationally efficient, perhaps by using a lighter architecture or by incorporating techniques like knowledge distillation to transfer the knowledge of a larger, more accurate model to a smaller, faster one. These optimizations are crucial for making the model practical for real-time applications and for reducing its resource consumption. Furthermore, exploring alternative inference strategies, such as caching intermediate results, could also help improve the overall speed. To address the risk of overfitting and improve the diversity of generated text, several techniques should be considered. Firstly, regularization methods, such as dropout or weight decay, could be applied more aggressively to prevent the model from memorizing the training data. Secondly, the training data could be augmented with style-mixed data to encourage the model to learn more robust style representations. Finally, techniques such as nucleus sampling or temperature scaling could be used during inference to encourage the model to generate more diverse outputs. These methods would help to ensure that the model can generate a wider range of stylistically consistent text, rather than falling into repetitive patterns. The authors should also explore techniques to balance style consistency with diversity, such as introducing randomness in the style adaptation process or using a diversity-promoting loss function. It is important to ensure that the model can generate diverse and creative text within each style while maintaining consistency. The authors should also provide a qualitative analysis of the generated text to assess its diversity and creativity. This analysis should include examples of generated text that demonstrate both high consistency and high diversity. To provide a more thorough analysis of the computational overhead, the authors should quantify the increase in FLOPs, parameter count, and memory usage due to the added style classification and adaptation modules. Furthermore, the authors should analyze the inference time of each module separately to pinpoint the bottlenecks in the architecture. This analysis should be performed on all datasets used in the paper to ensure consistency. It would also be beneficial to compare the computational overhead of the proposed method with other style-aware language models to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its efficiency. The authors should also explore techniques to optimize the computational efficiency of the Multi-Style Adapter, such as model compression or quantization, to mitigate the observed slowdown in inference speed. This would make the proposed method more practical for real-world applications. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, the authors should conduct a more rigorous evaluation of the model's generalization capabilities on unseen data. This could involve training the model on a subset of the data and evaluating its performance on a held-out set. Additionally, the authors should explore regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, to prevent the model from memorizing the training data. Data augmentation techniques, such as introducing noise or variations in the training data, could also be used to improve the model's robustness. The authors should also investigate the impact of the style loss weight on the model's generalization performance and provide guidelines for selecting an appropriate value. It is crucial to ensure that the model learns generalizable style representations rather than memorizing style patterns in the training data. The authors should also consider using a separate dataset for training the style classifier to avoid potential bias. To address the trade-off between style consistency and diversity, the authors should include metrics that quantify the diversity of the generated text, such as n-gram diversity or self-BLEU scores. They should also explore how the model's parameters, such as the style loss weight and the frequency of StyleAdapter application, affect this trade-off. The authors should investigate techniques to balance style consistency with diversity, such as introducing randomness in the style adaptation process or using a diversity-promoting loss function. It is important to ensure that the model can generate diverse and creative text within each style while maintaining consistency. The authors should also provide a qualitative analysis of the generated text to assess its diversity and creativity. This analysis should include examples of generated text that demonstrate both high consistency and high diversity. Finally, the authors should conduct a sensitivity analysis of the model's performance to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the weight of the style loss (λ) and the frequency of StyleAdapter application. This analysis should explore how the model's performance varies with different values of these hyperparameters. The authors should also evaluate the model's performance on datasets with very similar styles to assess the risk of style confusion. Furthermore, the authors should explore the scalability of the approach to larger language models and discuss the potential modifications that would be necessary to apply the Multi-Style Adapter to other language model architectures beyond GPT. The authors should also discuss the potential adjustments required to apply the approach to word-level or subword-level models.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nSeveral key questions arise from my analysis of this paper. First, how does the Multi-Style Adapter approach scale with larger datasets and more complex language models? The paper uses a relatively small model with 6 transformer layers, and it's unclear how the approach would perform with models that have billions of parameters. Are there any limitations in terms of memory or computational requirements that would prevent the approach from scaling to larger models? Second, given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets, how can the risk of overfitting be mitigated, and what are the implications for the model's generalization capabilities? The paper acknowledges this risk, but it doesn't provide a detailed analysis of how the model would perform on unseen data or how to prevent the model from memorizing style patterns. What techniques could be used to improve the model's generalization capabilities and ensure that it learns robust style representations? Third, how does the model handle cases where the desired style might evolve or change over the course of the generated text? The paper mentions that the style classification head dynamically infers the style of the input sequence, but it's unclear how well the model handles rapid or complex style evolutions within a single sequence. Is there a mechanism to allow for dynamic style shifts within a single sequence, and how does the model ensure a smooth transition between different styles? Fourth, can the Multi-Style Adapter be effectively applied to other language model architectures beyond GPT, and what modifications would be necessary? The paper focuses on the GPT architecture, but it's unclear how the approach would generalize to other architectures, such as encoder-decoder models or models with different attention mechanisms. What specific modifications would be required to adapt the Multi-Style Adapter to other architectures, and how would these modifications affect the model's performance? Fifth, the paper focuses on character-level language models. How would the approach perform on word-level or subword-level models, and what adjustments would be required? The paper does not discuss the application to word-level or subword-level models, and it's unclear how the approach would need to be modified to work with these different levels of granularity. What are the potential challenges and opportunities of applying the Multi-Style Adapter to word-level or subword-level models? Finally, how sensitive is the model’s performance to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the weight of the style loss (λ) and the frequency of StyleAdapter application? The paper mentions the specific values used for these hyperparameters but lacks a sensitivity analysis. How does the model's performance vary with different values of these hyperparameters, and what are the optimal values for achieving a balance between style consistency and language modeling performance? These questions highlight key uncertainties and areas for future research, focusing on the core methodological choices and assumptions of the paper. Addressing these questions would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of the Multi-Style Adapter and would help to guide future research in this area.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.75\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",
                "summary": "This paper introduces the Multi-Style Adapter, a novel approach designed to enhance style awareness and consistency in character-level language models. The core contribution lies in the integration of learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and a StyleAdapter module within the GPT architecture. This architecture aims to modulate the hidden states of the language model based on the inferred style, thereby achieving fine-grained stylistic control during text generation. The method is evaluated on three datasets: shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8, demonstrating high style consistency and competitive language modeling performance. The authors report near-perfect style consistency scores across all datasets, along with improved validation losses compared to a baseline GPT model. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased computational complexity, leading to slower inference speeds. The paper's significance lies in its attempt to address the challenge of maintaining style consistency in generated text, a crucial aspect for various applications in natural language generation. The proposed Multi-Style Adapter offers a mechanism to incorporate stylistic information into the generation process, potentially enabling more controllable and diverse text generation. The approach involves defining a fixed set of style embeddings, which are learned during training. A style classification head is used to infer the style of the input sequence, and the StyleAdapter module modulates the hidden states of the transformer layers based on the inferred style. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high style consistency, with scores reaching 1.0 on the enwik8 and text8 datasets. The authors also report improved validation losses, indicating that the Multi-Style Adapter does not significantly degrade the language modeling performance. However, the paper also acknowledges a reduction in inference speed, with the Multi-Style Adapter being approximately 40% slower than the baseline. Additionally, the paper raises concerns about the potential for overfitting, particularly given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets. The authors also note the increased computational complexity of the proposed method, with higher parameter counts, FLOPs per token, and memory usage compared to the baseline. Despite these limitations, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of style-aware language modeling, offering a novel approach to incorporate stylistic information into the generation process. The method's ability to achieve high style consistency while maintaining competitive language modeling performance makes it a promising direction for future research. However, the identified weaknesses, such as the reliance on a predefined set of styles, the reduction in inference speed, and the potential for overfitting, need to be addressed to make the approach more practical and robust. The paper's exploration of the trade-offs between style consistency and computational efficiency provides valuable insights for future work in this area. Overall, the paper presents a significant step towards more controllable and diverse text generation, but further research is needed to overcome the identified limitations.",

                "strengths": "The primary strength of this paper lies in its introduction of the Multi-Style Adapter, a novel architecture designed to enhance style awareness and consistency in character-level language models. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it addresses the challenging problem of maintaining stylistic coherence in generated text. The proposed method effectively integrates learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and a StyleAdapter module within the GPT architecture, allowing for fine-grained control over the style of generated text. This approach represents a technical innovation in the way stylistic information is incorporated into the language generation process. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Multi-Style Adapter in achieving high style consistency across multiple datasets. The authors report near-perfect style consistency scores, with values reaching 1.0 on the enwik8 and text8 datasets, indicating that the model can effectively maintain the desired style throughout the generated text. This is a significant achievement, as it shows that the proposed method can successfully control the style of the generated output. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that the Multi-Style Adapter maintains competitive language modeling performance, with improved validation losses compared to the baseline GPT model. This is an important finding, as it shows that the incorporation of stylistic information does not significantly degrade the model's ability to generate coherent and fluent text. The authors report a slight improvement in validation loss, indicating that the Multi-Style Adapter can enhance both style consistency and language modeling capabilities. The ablation studies and comparisons with baseline models further support the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with the Multi-Style Adapter, including parameter counts, FLOPs per token, and memory usage. This analysis is valuable for understanding the computational overhead of the proposed method and for comparing it with other approaches. The paper also includes a comparison with three state-of-the-art style-aware language models, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance. This comparison demonstrates that the Multi-Style Adapter achieves competitive performance compared to existing methods. The paper's focus on character-level language models is also a strength, as it allows for a more fine-grained control over the generated text. This is particularly important for applications where stylistic variations are subtle and require precise control. Overall, the paper presents a well-designed and thoroughly evaluated approach to style-aware language modeling, making a valuable contribution to the field.",
                "weaknesses": "While the paper presents a novel approach to style-aware language modeling, several weaknesses limit its applicability and impact. A primary concern is the reliance on a predefined and finite set of styles. As explicitly stated in the method section, the model uses a fixed number of learnable style embeddings, with K=4 representing the number of predefined styles. This assumption limits the model's ability to handle novel or dynamic styles not encountered during training, hindering its performance in real-world scenarios where stylistic diversity is common. The model's reliance on a fixed set of style embeddings means it cannot adapt to styles outside this predefined set, which is a significant limitation. This is a high-confidence issue, directly supported by the method's description. Another significant weakness is the substantial reduction in inference speed. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the Multi-Style Adapter is approximately 40% slower than the baseline GPT model across all datasets. For instance, the inference speed for shakespeare_char drops from 666.51 tokens/s (baseline) to 411.93 tokens/s (Multi-Style Adapter). This slowdown is a practical concern, impacting the usability of the model in time-sensitive applications. While the authors acknowledge this reduction, they do not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with the style classification and adaptation modules, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact sources of the slowdown. This is a high-confidence issue, supported by the reported inference speed values. The paper also acknowledges the risk of overfitting, particularly given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets. The style consistency scores for enwik8 and text8 are reported as 1.0, which raises concerns that the model may be memorizing style patterns rather than learning generalizable style representations. This is a high-confidence issue, supported by the reported style consistency scores. The perfect consistency scores, while seemingly positive, suggest a lack of diversity in the generated text, potentially leading to repetitive or formulaic outputs. This is a significant limitation, as it undermines the model's ability to generate varied and creative text within each style. The increased computational complexity of the Multi-Style Adapter is another significant weakness. The paper reports an increase in parameters from 124M (baseline) to 127M (Ours), an increase in FLOPs per token from 1.2G to 1.3G, and an increase in memory usage from 4.8GB to 5.1GB. This added complexity leads to slower inference speeds and higher resource consumption, which may limit its scalability for larger models or datasets. This is a high-confidence issue, supported by the reported computational metrics. The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the Multi-Style Adapter. While the authors acknowledge a reduction in inference speed, they do not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with the style classification and adaptation modules. Specifically, the paper does not quantify the increase in FLOPs or parameter count due to the added modules, making it difficult to assess the true computational impact. A more granular analysis, perhaps including a breakdown of the time spent in each module during inference, would be beneficial. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper provides overall parameter and FLOPs counts but lacks a detailed breakdown per module. The paper does not adequately address the potential for overfitting, especially given the perfect consistency scores on some datasets. The authors should investigate the model's generalization capabilities on unseen data and explore techniques to mitigate overfitting, such as regularization or data augmentation. The perfect consistency scores, while seemingly positive, raise concerns that the model may be memorizing style patterns rather than learning generalizable style representations. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper lacks explicit investigation into generalization or mitigation techniques. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the trade-off between style consistency and diversity in the generated text. The current evaluation focuses primarily on consistency, but it is equally important to ensure that the model can generate diverse and creative text within each style. The paper should include metrics that quantify the diversity of the generated text, such as n-gram diversity or self-BLEU scores, and explore how the model's parameters affect this trade-off. It is crucial to understand if the model sacrifices diversity for the sake of consistency. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper explicitly lists evaluation metrics, which does not include diversity metrics. The paper also lacks a sensitivity analysis of the model's performance to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the weight of the style loss (λ) and the frequency of StyleAdapter application. The paper mentions the specific values used for these hyperparameters but lacks a sensitivity analysis. Without a sensitivity analysis, it's unclear how performance varies with these hyperparameters. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper states the fixed values used for the style loss weight and StyleAdapter application frequency without exploring their impact through sensitivity analysis. The paper does not explicitly evaluate the model's performance on very similar styles. The experimental setup does not include scenarios with highly similar styles to assess potential confusion. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper lacks experiments or discussion on style confusion with similar styles. The paper uses a relatively small model and does not discuss scaling to larger models. The paper describes a model with a limited number of layers and does not provide analysis or experiments on larger models. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper describes a model with a limited number of layers and does not provide analysis or experiments on larger models. Finally, the paper focuses on character-level language models and does not discuss the application to word-level or subword-level models. The paper's explicit focus on character-level language models indicates that the applicability to other levels is not explored. This is a high-confidence issue, as the paper explicitly focuses on character-level models.",
                "suggestions": "To address the identified weaknesses, several concrete improvements can be made. First, to overcome the limitation of a predefined style set, future work should explore methods for handling a continuous style space. This could involve techniques such as learning a style embedding from a descriptive text or using a variational approach to sample styles from a distribution. Such methods would allow the model to generalize to unseen styles and adapt to more nuanced stylistic variations. For example, instead of relying on fixed embeddings, the model could learn a mapping from style descriptors to style embeddings, enabling it to handle a wider range of stylistic inputs.

For instance, the authors could discuss how the limited degrees of freedom in low-dimensional data might lead to overfitting or how the standard noise schedules might not be appropriate for capturing the underlying data distribution. A more detailed explanation of why existing diffusion models struggle in this regime is needed.

For example, they could explain how the coarse grid captures the overall structure of the data, while the fine grid allows for localized adjustments, and how this is particularly beneficial for low-dimensional data.

For example, they could discuss how their method could be used to generate synthetic data for training machine learning models in scientific simulations or how it could be used to improve the accuracy of financial forecasting models.

For instance, the authors could discuss how the limited degrees of freedom in low-dimensional data might lead to overfitting or how the standard noise schedules might not be appropriate for capturing the underlying data distribution. A more detailed explanation of why existing diffusion models struggle in this regime is needed. The authors should provide a more thorough explanation of how their multi-scale grid approach addresses these specific challenges. For example, they could explain how the coarse grid captures the overall structure of the data, while the fine grid allows for localized adjustments, and how this is particularly beneficial for low-dimensional data. The authors should also discuss the limitations of their approach and under what conditions it might not be effective. This would help to clarify the scope of their contribution and provide a more balanced view of their work.\n\nTo strengthen the paper's contribution, the authors should explicitly state how their work advances the state-of-the-art in diffusion models or low-dimensional data processing. They should clearly explain how their method differs from existing approaches and why it is a significant improvement. For example, they could compare their method to other techniques for adapting diffusion models to different data types or discuss how their approach could be generalized to other low-dimensional data modalities. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of their method compared to standard diffusion models. This would help to assess the practical applicability of their approach. Furthermore, the authors should consider including a discussion on the potential impact of their work, such as how it could enable new applications or research directions in fields that rely on low-dimensional data.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide a more rigorous justification for the importance of improving diffusion models specifically for low-dimensional data. While the paper mentions potential applications in scientific simulations, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis, it does not provide concrete examples or use cases. The authors could include specific examples of how their method could be used to solve real-world problems in these domains. For example, they could discuss how their method could be used to generate synthetic data for training machine learning models in scientific simulations or how it could be used to improve the accuracy of financial forecasting models. By providing more concrete examples and use cases, the authors could better demonstrate the significance and impact of their work.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Can the authors provide more detailed insights into the computational overhead introduced by the multi-scale grid mechanism? How does the additional complexity impact the scalability of the model for larger datasets or higher-dimensional data?\n2. Are there any ablation studies that demonstrate the individual contributions of the coarse and fine grids to the overall performance improvement? Understanding the relative impact of each component could provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 3\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes a multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism to enhance diffusion models in low-dimensional spaces.

It should provide concrete examples of scenarios where current generative models, such as GANs or VAEs, struggle with low-dimensional data. For instance, are there issues with mode collapse, lack of diversity, or poor sample quality? The authors should then explain how diffusion models, with their iterative denoising process, can potentially overcome these limitations. This section should also discuss the unique challenges that low-dimensional data presents for diffusion models, such as the potential for overfitting or the need for more precise noise scheduling. By establishing this context, the motivation for the proposed method will be much clearer, and the reader will better understand the significance of the problem being addressed.\n\nTo strengthen the contribution of the paper, the authors should explicitly state the novelty of their multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism. How does this approach differ from existing techniques for adapting diffusion models to different data types?

The authors should also discuss the limitations of their approach, such as the computational cost of the grid-based method and how this cost scales with the size of the grid and the dimensionality of the data. A thorough discussion of these limitations will provide a more balanced view of the proposed method and help guide future research in this area.\n\nFinally, the experimental evaluation should be expanded to include more complex and higher-dimensional low-dimensional datasets. The authors should also provide a discussion of the potential challenges and limitations of applying the method to higher-dimensional data. For example, how would the grid-based approach scale to 3D or higher-dimensional data, and what modifications might be necessary? The paper should also include a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, especially in comparison to standard diffusion models. This analysis should include the training time, inference time, and memory usage of the proposed method. By addressing these points, the paper will be more comprehensive and provide a more thorough evaluation of the proposed method.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism designed to enhance the performance of diffusion models when applied to low-dimensional data. The core idea revolves around using a combination of coarse and fine grids to dynamically adjust noise levels during the diffusion process. This approach aims to address the challenges posed by the limited spatial complexity and increased sensitivity to noise scheduling often encountered in low-dimensional datasets. The authors propose that the coarse grid captures the overall structure of the data, while the fine grid allows for localized adjustments, thereby improving the model's ability to capture the nuances of the data distribution. To prevent overfitting in the fine-grained adjustments, they incorporate L1 regularization. The method is evaluated on four diverse 2D datasets—circle, dino, line, and moons—and two 3D datasets—sphere and helix—demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching compared to standard diffusion models. The empirical findings are supported by metrics such as KL divergence and visual comparisons. The authors also provide a computational analysis, showing that training time scales linearly with the total grid parameters, and that the inference overhead remains below 15%. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of this method for various applications, including scientific simulations, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis, and suggests future research directions, such as extending the method to higher-dimensional datasets and developing adaptive grid sizing techniques. Overall, the paper presents a novel approach to adapting diffusion models for low-dimensional data, with promising empirical results and a clear path for future research. However, as I will discuss, there are some areas where the paper could be strengthened, particularly in terms of motivation, contribution, and limitations.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nI found several aspects of this paper to be quite compelling. The core strength lies in the innovative multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism. This approach, which combines coarse and fine grids to dynamically adjust noise levels during the diffusion process, is a novel way to address the challenges of low-dimensional data. The idea of using the coarse grid to capture the overall structure and the fine grid for localized adjustments is both intuitive and effective. The use of L1 regularization on the fine grid to encourage sparsity and prevent overfitting is a sound technical innovation. Empirically, the paper presents a thorough evaluation of the proposed method on four diverse 2D datasets and two 3D datasets. The results consistently demonstrate significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching compared to standard diffusion models. The use of clear metrics such as KL divergence and visual comparisons strengthens the empirical findings. The authors also provide a computational analysis, showing that training time scales linearly with the total grid parameters, and that the inference overhead remains below 15%. This analysis is crucial for assessing the practical applicability of the proposed method. Furthermore, the paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the methodology, experimental setup, and results. The authors clearly articulate the key contributions of their work in the introduction and conclusion, making it easy for the reader to understand the significance of their findings. The inclusion of future research directions also highlights the potential for further development and application of this method. The paper's focus on low-dimensional data, an area often overlooked in the context of diffusion models, is a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. Firstly, the motivation for adapting diffusion models to low-dimensional data, while present, is not as clearly articulated as it could be. The paper states that low-dimensional data is prevalent in scientific and industrial applications and that standard diffusion models struggle with limited spatial complexity and increased sensitivity to noise scheduling. However, it lacks a detailed explanation of *why* these challenges are significant and *how* standard diffusion models specifically fail in this context. For instance, the paper does not cite specific works that demonstrate the struggles of standard diffusion models on low-dimensional data, nor does it provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of other existing methods for low-dimensional data generation, such as GANs or VAEs. This lack of context makes it difficult to fully appreciate the importance of the problem being addressed. This is a partially valid concern with medium confidence, as the paper does mention the challenges but lacks specific citations or detailed explanations of *how* standard diffusion models struggle in this context. Secondly, the contribution of the proposed method to the broader field of diffusion models or low-dimensional data processing is not clearly stated. While the paper lists its contributions in the introduction and conclusion, it does not explicitly position these contributions against the existing state-of-the-art in a comparative manner. The paper introduces a multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism and an L1 regularization technique, but it does not clearly explain how these advancements differ from existing techniques for adapting diffusion models to different data types. The potential impact of this work on the broader research community is also not thoroughly discussed. This is a partially valid concern with medium confidence, as the paper states its contributions but lacks a clear comparative statement against the existing state-of-the-art within the introduction or conclusion. Thirdly, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed method. While the authors acknowledge increased computational complexity and the need for dataset-specific tuning of grid sizes and regularization strength, they do not provide a detailed analysis of how the performance scales with the dimensionality of the data. The paper also lacks a discussion on the types of low-dimensional distributions for which this method might not be suitable. Although the paper provides some computational analysis, it does not delve into the sensitivity of the method to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the grid sizes and regularization strength, beyond stating the chosen values. This is a partially valid concern with medium confidence, as the paper mentions some limitations and provides some computational analysis, but lacks detail on distribution suitability and hyperparameter sensitivity. Finally, the experimental evaluation, while including 3D datasets, is limited in scope. The paper does not include experiments on more complex or real-world datasets, and it does not discuss the potential challenges or modifications needed for scaling the grid-based approach beyond 3D. The paper acknowledges the need to explore higher-dimensional data in future work, but it does not provide a detailed discussion of the potential challenges or limitations of applying the method to higher-dimensional data. This is a partially valid concern with medium confidence, as the paper includes 3D experiments but lacks discussion on scaling beyond 3D and evaluation on real-world data.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. Firstly, the paper should provide a more detailed and nuanced discussion of the challenges associated with generating low-dimensional data using existing methods. This should include specific examples of scenarios where current generative models, such as GANs or VAEs, struggle with low-dimensional data. For instance, the authors could discuss issues with mode collapse, lack of diversity, or poor sample quality. They should then explain how diffusion models, with their iterative denoising process, can potentially overcome these limitations. This section should also discuss the unique challenges that low-dimensional data presents for diffusion models, such as the potential for overfitting or the need for more precise noise scheduling. By establishing this context, the motivation for the proposed method will be much clearer, and the reader will better understand the significance of the problem being addressed. Secondly, the paper should explicitly state the novelty of their multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism. How does this approach differ from existing techniques for adapting diffusion models to different data types? The authors should also discuss the potential impact of this work on the broader research community. For example, could this method be applied to other types of generative models, or could the multi-scale grid approach be used for other tasks beyond low-dimensional data generation? The authors should also discuss the limitations of their approach, such as the computational cost of the grid-based method and how this cost scales with the size of the grid and the dimensionality of the data. A thorough discussion of these limitations will provide a more balanced view of the proposed method and help guide future research in this area. Thirdly, the paper should include a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, especially in comparison to standard diffusion models. This analysis should include the training time, inference time, and memory usage of the proposed method. The authors should provide a breakdown of the computational cost associated with the grid-based noise adaptation mechanism, and how this cost scales with the size of the grid and the dimensionality of the data. It would be beneficial to compare the computational cost of the proposed method with other existing methods for low-dimensional data generation, if available. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the sensitivity of the method to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the grid sizes and regularization strength, and how these parameters should be tuned for different datasets. The authors should provide guidelines for selecting appropriate hyperparameter values, and discuss the trade-offs between performance and computational cost. Finally, the paper should include experiments on more challenging datasets, or at least provide a discussion of the potential challenges and limitations of applying the method to higher-dimensional data. For example, the authors could consider evaluating the method on datasets with more complex geometric structures or higher dimensionality. The paper should also consider evaluating the method on real-world datasets, which may have different characteristics than the synthetic datasets used in the experiments. This would provide a more realistic assessment of the method's performance and applicability. The authors should also discuss the potential limitations of the grid-based approach when applied to very high-dimensional data, and how these limitations might be addressed. For example, the authors could explore alternative approaches for adapting noise levels in high-dimensional spaces, such as using learned noise schedules or adaptive sampling techniques.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe would be beneficial for the authors to address. Firstly, can the authors provide more context on why enhancing diffusion models for low-dimensional data is an important problem to solve? What are the specific challenges that low-dimensional data presents for diffusion models, and how do these challenges differ from those encountered in high-dimensional data? Secondly, how does the proposed multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion models or low-dimensional data processing? What is the broader impact of this work, and how does it compare to existing techniques for adapting diffusion models to different data types? Thirdly, what are the limitations of the proposed method? How does the performance scale with the dimensionality of the data, and are there specific types of low-dimensional distributions for which this method is not suitable? Fourthly, how would the proposed method perform on more complex or higher-dimensional low-dimensional data? Are there any plans to evaluate the method on such datasets, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of applying the method to higher-dimensional data? Finally, can the authors provide more details on the computational cost of the proposed method compared to standard diffusion models? How does the additional complexity of the grid-based noise adaptation mechanism impact the training and inference times, and what are the trade-offs between performance and computational cost? These questions aim to clarify the motivation, contribution, limitations, and future directions of the proposed method, and I believe that addressing them would significantly strengthen the paper.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism designed to enhance the performance of diffusion models when applied to low-dimensional data. The core idea revolves around using a combination of coarse and fine grids to dynamically adjust noise levels during the diffusion process. This approach aims to address the challenges posed by the limited spatial complexity and increased sensitivity to noise scheduling often encountered in low-dimensional datasets. The authors propose that the coarse grid captures the overall structure of the data, while the fine grid allows for localized adjustments, thereby improving the model's ability to capture the nuances of the data distribution. To prevent overfitting in the fine-grained adjustments, they incorporate L1 regularization. The method is evaluated on four diverse 2D datasets—circle, dino, line, and moons—and two 3D datasets—sphere and helix—demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching compared to standard diffusion models. The empirical findings are supported by metrics such as KL divergence and visual comparisons. The authors also provide a computational analysis, showing that training time scales linearly with the total grid parameters, and that the inference overhead remains below 15%. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of this method for various applications, including scientific simulations, financial modeling, and geospatial analysis, and suggests future research directions, such as extending the method to higher-dimensional datasets and developing adaptive grid sizing techniques. Overall, the paper presents a novel approach to adapting diffusion models for low-dimensional data, with promising empirical results and a clear path for future research. However, as I will discuss, there are some areas where the paper could be strengthened, particularly in terms of motivation, contribution, and limitations.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nI found several aspects of this paper to be quite compelling. The core strength lies in the innovative multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism. This approach, which combines coarse and fine grids to dynamically adjust noise levels during the diffusion process, is a novel way to address the challenges of low-dimensional data. The idea of using the coarse grid to capture the overall structure and the fine grid for localized adjustments is both intuitive and effective. The use of L1 regularization on the fine grid to encourage sparsity and prevent overfitting is a sound technical innovation. Empirically, the paper presents a thorough evaluation of the proposed method on four diverse 2D datasets and two 3D datasets. The results consistently demonstrate significant improvements in sample quality and distribution matching compared to standard diffusion models.

The inclusion of future research directions also highlights the potential for further development and application of this method. The paper's focus on low-dimensional data, an area often overlooked in the context of diffusion models, is a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. Firstly, the motivation for adapting diffusion models to low-dimensional data, while present, is not as clearly articulated as it could be. The paper states that low-dimensional data is prevalent in scientific and industrial applications and that standard diffusion models struggle with limited spatial complexity and increased sensitivity to noise scheduling. However, it lacks a detailed explanation of *why* these challenges are significant and *how* standard diffusion models specifically fail in this context. For instance, the paper does not cite specific works that demonstrate the struggles of standard diffusion models on low-dimensional data, nor does it provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of other existing methods for low-dimensional data generation, such as GANs or VAEs. This lack of context makes it difficult to fully appreciate the importance of the problem being addressed. This is a partially valid concern with medium confidence, as the paper does mention the challenges but lacks specific citations or detailed explanations of *how* standard diffusion models struggle in this context. Secondly, the contribution of the proposed method to the broader field of diffusion models or low-dimensional data processing is not clearly stated. While the paper lists its contributions in the introduction and conclusion, it does not explicitly position these contributions against the existing state-of-the-art in a comparative manner. The paper introduces a multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism and an L1 regularization technique, but it does not clearly explain how these advancements differ from existing techniques for adapting diffusion models to different data types. The potential impact of this work on the broader research community is also not thoroughly discussed. This is a partially valid concern with medium confidence, as the paper states its contributions but lacks a clear comparative statement against the existing state-of-the-art within the introduction or conclusion. Thirdly, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed method. While the authors acknowledge increased computational complexity and the need for dataset-specific tuning of grid sizes and regularization strength, they do not provide a detailed analysis of how the performance scales with the dimensionality of the data. The paper also lacks a discussion on the types of low-dimensional distributions for which this method might not be suitable. Although the paper provides some computational analysis, it does not delve into the sensitivity of the method to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the grid sizes and regularization strength, beyond stating the chosen values. This is a partially valid concern with medium confidence, as the paper mentions some limitations and provides some computational analysis, but lacks detail on distribution suitability and hyperparameter sensitivity. Finally, the experimental evaluation, while including 3D datasets, is limited in scope. The paper does not include experiments on more complex or real-world datasets, and it does not discuss the potential challenges or modifications needed for scaling the grid-based approach beyond 3D. The paper acknowledges the need to explore higher-dimensional data in future work, but it does not provide a detailed discussion of the potential challenges or limitations of applying the method to higher-dimensional data. This is a partially valid concern with medium confidence, as the paper includes 3D experiments but lacks discussion on scaling beyond 3D and evaluation on real-world data.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. Firstly, the paper should provide a more detailed and nuanced discussion of the challenges associated with generating low-dimensional data using existing methods. This should include specific examples of scenarios where current generative models, such as GANs or VAEs, struggle with low-dimensional data. For instance, the authors could discuss issues with mode collapse, lack of diversity, or poor sample quality. They should then explain how diffusion models, with their iterative denoising process, can potentially overcome these limitations. This section should also discuss the unique challenges that low-dimensional data presents for diffusion models, such as the potential for overfitting or the need for more precise noise scheduling. By establishing this context, the motivation for the proposed method will be much clearer, and the reader will better understand the significance of the problem being addressed. Secondly, the paper should explicitly state the novelty of their multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism. How does this approach differ from existing techniques for adapting diffusion models to different data types? The authors should also discuss the potential impact of this work on the broader research community. For example, could this method be applied to other types of generative models, or could the multi-scale grid approach be used for other tasks beyond low-dimensional data generation? The authors should also discuss the limitations of their approach, such as the computational cost of the grid-based method and how this cost scales with the size of the grid and the dimensionality of the data. A thorough discussion of these limitations will provide a more balanced view of the proposed method and help guide future research in this area. Thirdly, the paper should include a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, especially in comparison to standard diffusion models. This analysis should include the training time, inference time, and memory usage of the proposed method. The authors should provide a breakdown of the computational cost associated with the grid-based noise adaptation mechanism, and how this cost scales with the size of the grid and the dimensionality of the data. It would be beneficial to compare the computational cost of the proposed method with other existing methods for low-dimensional data generation, if available. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the sensitivity of the method to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the grid sizes and regularization strength, and how these parameters should be tuned for different datasets. The authors should provide guidelines for selecting appropriate hyperparameter values, and discuss the trade-offs between performance and computational cost. Finally, the paper should include experiments on more challenging datasets, or at least provide a discussion of the potential challenges and limitations of applying the method to higher-dimensional data. For example, the authors could consider evaluating the method on datasets with more complex geometric structures or higher dimensionality. The paper should also consider evaluating the method on real-world datasets, which may have different characteristics than the synthetic datasets used in the experiments. This would provide a more realistic assessment of the method's performance and applicability. The authors should also discuss the potential limitations of the grid-based approach when applied to very high-dimensional data, and how these limitations might be addressed. For example, the authors could explore alternative approaches for adapting noise levels in high-dimensional spaces, such as using learned noise schedules or adaptive sampling techniques.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe would be beneficial for the authors to address. Firstly, can the authors provide more context on why enhancing diffusion models for low-dimensional data is an important problem to solve? What are the specific challenges that low-dimensional data presents for diffusion models, and how do these challenges differ from those encountered in high-dimensional data? Secondly, how does the proposed multi-scale grid-based noise adaptation mechanism advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion models or low-dimensional data processing? What is the broader impact of this work, and how does it compare to existing techniques for adapting diffusion models to different data types? Thirdly, what are the limitations of the proposed method? How does the performance scale with the dimensionality of the data, and are there specific types of low-dimensional distributions for which this method is not suitable? Fourthly, how would the proposed method perform on more complex or higher-dimensional low-dimensional data? Are there any plans to evaluate the method on such datasets, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of applying the method to higher-dimensional data? Finally, can the authors provide more details on the computational cost of the proposed method compared to standard diffusion models? How does the additional complexity of the grid-based noise adaptation mechanism impact the training and inference times, and what are the trade-offs between performance and computational cost? These questions aim to clarify the motivation, contribution, limitations, and future directions of the proposed method, and I believe that addressing them would significantly strengthen the paper.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",

The novelty of this paper is limited. The authors do not introduce a new model, but only add an additional discriminator to improve the sample quality of diffusion models. The authors also do not apply the proposed model to meaningful real-world applications.\n\n2. The experiments are very weak. First, the authors only evaluate the proposed method on simple 2D datasets. Second, the authors do not compare their method with other diffusion models or GANs. Third, the authors only provide very limited metrics to evaluate the models, such as training time, evaluation loss, and KL divergence. Fourth, the authors do not provide details of the compared methods and do not provide details and visualization results of the datasets.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper's primary weakness lies in its limited novelty and lack of rigorous experimentation. While the idea of combining diffusion models and GANs is interesting, the implementation here appears to be a straightforward addition of a discriminator to a diffusion model without any significant architectural or methodological innovation. The authors should explore more sophisticated ways of integrating GANs into the diffusion framework, such as using the discriminator to guide the diffusion process itself, rather than just using it as a final quality check. Furthermore, the lack of application to real-world problems makes it difficult to assess the practical value of the proposed method. The authors should consider applying their method to more complex datasets and tasks to demonstrate its effectiveness.\n\nTo address the weak experimental setup, the authors should significantly expand their evaluation. First, they must evaluate their method on more complex and diverse datasets beyond simple 2D shapes. This could include image datasets such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, which are standard benchmarks for generative models. Second, a thorough comparison with existing state-of-the-art diffusion models and GANs is crucial. This would involve comparing the proposed method against models like DDPM, ScoreSDE, and various GAN architectures, using standard evaluation metrics such as FID and IS scores. The authors should also provide detailed information about the implementation of the compared methods, including hyperparameter settings and training procedures. Finally, the authors should provide more detailed visualizations of the generated samples, including comparisons with samples from other methods. This would help to qualitatively assess the sample quality and diversity achieved by the proposed method.\n\nIn addition to the above, the authors should also provide more detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. This includes the size of the datasets, the number of training and testing samples, and any preprocessing steps applied. The authors should also provide more details about the training process, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs. Furthermore, the authors should provide more comprehensive evaluation metrics, such as the Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which are widely used to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated samples. The authors should also provide ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of their method, such as the discriminator architecture and the adversarial loss function. This would help to understand the contribution of each component to the overall performance of the method.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. How does the proposed method perform compared to other diffusion models and GANs? The authors should compare their method with other diffusion models and GANs, and provide FID and IS scores [1,2] to evaluate the sample quality and diversity.\n\n2. How does the proposed method perform on meaningful real-world applications?

Next, I will generate verification content for these reviews:\n\n\\boxed_verification{\nThe reviewer has identified three main weaknesses: limited novelty, weak experiments (specifically on simple 2D datasets, lack of comparison with other models, and limited metrics), and lack of application to real-world problems. I need to go through each of these and see if the paper provides sufficient justification or if the reviewer's claims are valid.\n\n**Weakness 1: Limited Novelty**\n- The reviewer claims the method is a straightforward addition of a discriminator.\n- I need to check the \"Method\" section, particularly the \"Overview\" and the descriptions of the denoiser and discriminator networks, as well as the loss functions.\n- I also need to see if the paper explicitly claims significant architectural or methodological innovation.\n\n**Weakness 2: Weak Experiments**\n- **Simple 2D Datasets:** The \"Experiments\" section clearly states the datasets used: Circle, Dino, Line, and Moons. These are indeed simple 2D datasets.\n- **Lack of Comparison:** I need to check the \"Experiments\" section, specifically the \"Baselines\" mentioned in each experiment's setup. It seems the baseline is a \"Standard diffusion model without GAN components.\"  The reviewer is correct that there's no comparison with other *types* of diffusion models or GANs.\n- **Limited Metrics:** The \"Metrics\" listed in the \"Experiments\" section are \"Training time, evaluation loss, KL divergence, and sample quality.\" The reviewer correctly points out the absence of standard generative model evaluation metrics like FID and IS.\n- **Lack of Details:** I need to check the \"Experiments\" section for details about the datasets and implementation of the baseline. The \"Datasets\" subsection provides some details, but perhaps not enough for the reviewer's satisfaction. The implementation details of the baseline are not explicitly mentioned beyond \"standard diffusion model.\"\n\n**Weakness 3: Lack of Real-World Applications**\n- I need to check the \"Introduction,\" \"Motivation,\" and \"Conclusion\" sections to see if the paper discusses or suggests real-world applications.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Address the novelty claim by examining the method description.\n2. Systematically go through the experimental setup and results to validate the claims about dataset simplicity, lack of comparison, and limited metrics.\n3. Check the paper for any mention of real-world applications.\n## Validation of Reviewer Weaknesses\n\nHere's a detailed analysis of the reviewer's weaknesses, supported by evidence from the paper:\n\n**Weakness 1:**\n1. Weakness Statement:\n\"The novelty of this paper is limited. The authors do not introduce a new model, but only add an additional discriminator to improve the sample quality of diffusion models. The authors also do not apply the proposed model to meaningful real-world applications.\"\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\na) Method-related Evidence:\n   - **Direct Quote (Method Overview):** \"The proposed method integrates a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework into a diffusion model to enhance sample quality and diversity. The core components include a denoiser network and a discriminator network.\"\n   - **Direct Quote (Discriminator Network):** \"The discriminator network, denoted as _D_ _ϕ_, distinguishes between real and generated samples. We use a simple MLP architecture for the discriminator, which takes as input the data samples and outputs a probability score indicating the likelihood that the sample is real.\"\n   - The paper explicitly states the integration of a GAN framework, which inherently involves a discriminator. The description of the discriminator network confirms its standard role in a GAN setup.\nb) Experiment-related Evidence:\n   - The \"Experiments\" section focuses solely on 2D datasets (Circle, Dino, Line, Moons). There is no mention of applying the model to complex, real-world datasets or tasks.\n\n3. Literature Gap Analysis:\n   - While the paper cites relevant works on diffusion models and GANs, it doesn't explicitly position its novelty against existing GAN-diffusion hybrid models in terms of architectural or methodological innovation.\n\n4. Validation Analysis:\n   - The reviewer's claim about limited novelty seems valid. The paper clearly describes adding a discriminator to a diffusion model, a concept explored in prior works. The lack of application to real-world scenarios further supports this claim.\n   - The paper's \"Main Idea\" section states: \"This paper introduces an enhanced diffusion model that integrates a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to improve sample quality and diversity.\" While the integration is the core idea, the reviewer correctly points out that the *mechanism* of integration (adding a discriminator) is not novel.\n   - The \"Future Work\" section mentions \"exploring more complex discriminator architectures, extending the model to higher-dimensional data, and investigating the impact of different adversarial loss functions.\" This implicitly acknowledges the current simplicity of the approach.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Validity status: **Valid**\n   - Confidence level: **High**\n   - Key supporting evidence: Direct quotes from the \"Method\" section describing the integration of a GAN and the discriminator network, and the exclusive use of simple 2D datasets in the \"Experiments\" section.\n\n**Weakness 2:**\n1. Weakness Statement:\n\"The experiments are very weak. First, the authors only evaluate the proposed method on simple 2D datasets. Second, the authors do not compare their method with other diffusion models or GANs. Third, the authors only provide very limited metrics to evaluate the models, such as training time, evaluation loss, and KL divergence. Fourth, the authors do not provide details of the compared methods and do not provide details and visualization results of the datasets.\"\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\na) Experiment-related Evidence:\n   - **Dataset Limitation:** The \"Experiments\" section explicitly lists the datasets used: \"Circle, Dino, Line, and Moons datasets.\" These are indeed simple, low-dimensional datasets.\n   - **Lack of Comparison:**\n     - **Baselines:** The \"setup\" subsection of each experiment states: \"The baseline is a standard diffusion model without GAN components.\" There is no comparison with other established diffusion models (e.g., DDPM, DDIM) or standalone GAN architectures.\n     - **Missing Baselines:**  The reviewer correctly points out the absence of comparisons with other diffusion models or GANs.\n   - **Limited Metrics:**\n     - **Metrics Used:** The \"metrics\" subsection lists: \"Training time, evaluation loss, KL divergence, and sample quality.\" The reviewer accurately notes the absence of standard generative model evaluation metrics like FID and IS.\n   - **Lack of Details:**\n     - **Compared Methods:** The description of the baseline is brief: \"standard diffusion model without GAN components.\" There are no specific architectural or training details provided for this baseline.\n     - **Dataset Details:** While the \"datasets\" subsection provides a brief description of each dataset (e.g., \"The Circle dataset consists of points arranged in a circle\"), it lacks detailed information about the data generation process, potential noise, or specific parameterizations.\n     - **Visualization:** The paper includes \"Figure 2: Generated samples from the GAN-enhanced diffusion model for each dataset.\" While this provides some visualization, it lacks direct comparisons with the baseline or other methods.\n\n3. Literature Gap Analysis:\n   - The \"Related Work\" section mentions several GAN-diffusion hybrid models, but the experimental section doesn't include comparisons against these methods.\n\n4. Validation Analysis:\n   - The reviewer's assessment of the experimental weaknesses is largely valid.\n   - The use of only simple 2D datasets limits the generalizability of the findings.\n   - The lack of comparison with other diffusion models and GANs makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed method.\n   - The limited set of evaluation metrics, particularly the absence of FID and IS, weakens the quantitative evaluation of sample quality and diversity.\n   - The lack of detailed information about the baseline implementation and dataset specifics hinders reproducibility and a thorough understanding of the experimental setup. While visualizations are present, the lack of comparative visualizations is a valid point.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Validity status: **Valid**\n   - Confidence level: **High**\n   - Key supporting evidence: The explicit listing of simple 2D datasets in the \"Experiments\" section, the description of the baseline as a \"standard diffusion model without GAN components\" without further details, the listed evaluation metrics, and the presence of visualizations without direct comparisons.\n\n**Weakness 3:**\n1. Weakness Statement:\n\"The authors also do not apply the proposed model to meaningful real-world applications.\"\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\na) Experiment-related Evidence:\n   - The \"Experiments\" section exclusively focuses on the synthetic 2D datasets mentioned earlier. There is no mention of applying the model to real-world datasets or tasks.\nb) Motivation Section:\n   - **Direct Quote (Motivation):** \"Generative models have become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, with applications ranging from image synthesis to data augmentation.\" This acknowledges the potential for real-world applications.\n   - **Direct Quote (Motivation):** \"Diffusion models, in particular, have shown remarkable success in generating high-quality samples across various data types.\" This also points towards the potential for broader application.\n   - **Direct Quote (Motivation):** \"However, despite their success, diffusion models often face challenges related to sample quality and diversity. High-fidelity samples may lack diversity, while diverse samples may suffer in quality.\" This highlights the problem the paper aims to solve, which is relevant to real-world applications.\nc) Conclusion Section:\n   - The \"Conclusions and Future Work\" section mentions \"Extending the model to higher-dimensional data and evaluating its performance on more complex datasets would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its capabilities.\" This implicitly acknowledges the current limitation to simpler datasets and the need for future work on more complex, potentially real-world, data.\n\n3. Literature Gap Analysis:\n   - The \"Related Work\" section mentions applications of GAN-diffusion hybrids in specific domains like medical imaging (Tiago et al., 2024), highlighting the potential for real-world applications that the current paper doesn't explore.\n\n4. Validation Analysis:\n   - The reviewer's point about the lack of application to real-world applications is valid. While the paper motivates the work by mentioning real-world applications of generative models, the experimental validation is limited to synthetic 2D datasets. The \"Future Work\" section further supports this by suggesting extensions to higher-dimensional data and more complex datasets.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Validity status: **Valid**\n   - Confidence level: **High**\n   - Key supporting evidence: The exclusive use of synthetic 2D datasets in the \"Experiments\" section and the suggestions in the \"Future Work\" section to extend the model to more complex data.\n\n**Synthesis and Reflection:**\n\nAll three weaknesses identified by the reviewer are valid and well-supported by evidence from the paper. There are no significant conflicts between the reviewer's statements. The core issues are the limited novelty of the approach, the narrow scope of the experimental validation, and the lack of demonstration on real-world applications. The reviewer's suggestions for improvement, such as comparing against state-of-the-art models, using standard evaluation metrics, and applying the method to more complex datasets, are pertinent and would significantly strengthen the paper.\n}\n\nNow, I have successfully verified each review. Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a hybrid generative model that combines the strengths of diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The core idea is to enhance the sample quality and diversity of diffusion models by incorporating a discriminator network, a key component of GANs. Specifically, the authors integrate a discriminator into the diffusion framework, which distinguishes between real and generated samples. The diffusion model's denoiser network is then modified to include an adversarial loss term, alongside the standard reconstruction loss, aiming to improve the fidelity of generated samples. To stabilize the training process, a gradient penalty is also introduced. The authors evaluate their proposed method on several simple 2D datasets, including Circle, Dino, Line, and Moons, and compare the results against a baseline diffusion model without GAN components. The evaluation metrics used include training time, evaluation loss, KL divergence, and a qualitative assessment of sample quality. The results suggest that the GAN-enhanced diffusion model achieves improvements in sample quality and diversity compared to the baseline. However, the paper does not explore comparisons with other state-of-the-art diffusion models or GANs, nor does it apply the method to more complex, real-world datasets. The primary contribution of this work lies in the integration of a discriminator into a diffusion model and the empirical demonstration of its impact on sample quality in a simplified setting. However, the paper's limitations, particularly in the scope of its experimental validation, restrict the generalizability and practical applicability of its findings. The paper's focus is primarily on demonstrating the feasibility of the hybrid approach, rather than achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex tasks. The authors acknowledge the need for future work to extend the model to higher-dimensional data and more complex datasets, indicating a clear understanding of the current limitations of their approach. The paper provides a foundational exploration of GAN-diffusion hybrids, but requires further development to realize its full potential.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nWhile the paper has several limitations, it does present some notable strengths. The core strength lies in the clear and straightforward integration of a GAN framework into a diffusion model. The authors successfully demonstrate that adding a discriminator network and an adversarial loss to the diffusion model's training process can lead to improvements in sample quality and diversity, at least on the simple 2D datasets considered. The method is clearly described, and the rationale behind each component, such as the discriminator network, the modified denoiser, and the gradient penalty, is well-articulated. The paper provides a detailed explanation of the architecture of the denoiser and discriminator networks, the loss functions used, and the training procedure. This clarity makes the paper accessible and easy to follow. The authors also provide a qualitative assessment of the generated samples, which, while not as rigorous as quantitative metrics like FID or IS, does offer some visual evidence of the improvements achieved by their method. The paper's focus on a foundational exploration of GAN-diffusion hybrids is a valuable contribution, as it provides a starting point for future research in this area. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their work and suggest directions for future research, such as exploring more complex discriminator architectures, extending the model to higher-dimensional data, and investigating the impact of different adversarial loss functions. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the current state of their work and its potential for future development. The paper's experimental setup, while limited, is well-defined and allows for a clear evaluation of the proposed method against a baseline diffusion model. The use of simple 2D datasets, though a limitation, allows for a clear visualization of the generated samples and facilitates the analysis of the model's behavior. The paper's focus on the fundamental behavior of GAN-enhanced diffusion in low-dimensional spaces is a valuable contribution, as it allows for a better understanding of the interaction between the components. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its clear presentation of a novel approach, its successful demonstration of the feasibility of integrating GANs into diffusion models, and its identification of promising directions for future research.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nThe paper suffers from several significant weaknesses that limit its impact and generalizability. The most prominent weakness is the limited novelty of the proposed method. As I have verified, the core idea of adding a discriminator to a diffusion model is not entirely new, and the paper does not introduce any significant architectural or methodological innovations in this regard. The authors themselves describe the method as an integration of a GAN framework into a diffusion model, which involves implementing a discriminator network and modifying the denoiser to include an adversarial loss term. This approach, while effective in principle, lacks substantial novelty compared to existing GAN-diffusion hybrid models. The paper's experimental setup is also a major weakness. The authors evaluate their method solely on simple 2D datasets, such as Circle, Dino, Line, and Moons. These datasets are not representative of the complexity of real-world data, and the results obtained on these datasets may not generalize to more challenging scenarios. The lack of evaluation on more complex datasets, such as image datasets like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, significantly limits the practical relevance of the findings. Furthermore, the paper does not compare the proposed method with other state-of-the-art diffusion models or GANs. The baseline used in the experiments is a standard diffusion model without GAN components, which is not sufficient to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The absence of comparisons with other established generative models makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed method. The evaluation metrics used in the paper are also limited. The authors rely on training time, evaluation loss, KL divergence, and a qualitative assessment of sample quality. They do not use standard metrics for evaluating generative models, such as the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) or the Inception Score (IS). The absence of these metrics makes it difficult to compare the performance of the proposed method with other generative models in the literature. The paper also lacks sufficient details about the compared methods and the datasets used. The description of the baseline diffusion model is brief, and the paper does not provide specific architectural or training details. Similarly, the descriptions of the datasets are high-level, lacking details about the data generation process or potential noise. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results and to fully understand the experimental setup. The absence of detailed visualizations of the generated samples, particularly comparative visualizations with the baseline, further hinders a thorough assessment of the method's performance. Finally, the paper does not apply the proposed method to any real-world applications. The focus is solely on generating samples on simple 2D datasets, and there is no demonstration of the method's effectiveness in practical tasks such as image synthesis or data augmentation. This lack of application to real-world problems limits the practical significance of the findings. In summary, the paper's weaknesses, including limited novelty, weak experimental setup, lack of comparison with other models, limited evaluation metrics, insufficient details, and lack of real-world applications, significantly undermine its overall contribution and impact. My confidence in these identified limitations is high, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and the absence of crucial elements in its methodology and experimental design.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete and actionable improvements. First, the authors should explore more sophisticated ways of integrating GANs into the diffusion framework. Instead of simply adding a discriminator and an adversarial loss, they could investigate using the discriminator to guide the diffusion process itself, perhaps by incorporating discriminator feedback into the denoising steps or using the discriminator's feature space to inform the diffusion model's training. This would require a more in-depth architectural and methodological innovation, moving beyond a straightforward combination of existing components. Second, the authors must significantly expand their experimental evaluation. This includes evaluating their method on more complex and diverse datasets, such as image datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, or ImageNet. These datasets are standard benchmarks for generative models and would provide a more rigorous assessment of the method's capabilities. Furthermore, the authors should evaluate their method on datasets from other domains, such as audio or time-series data, to demonstrate its broader applicability. Third, a thorough comparison with existing state-of-the-art diffusion models and GANs is crucial. This would involve comparing the proposed method against models like DDPM, ScoreSDE, and various GAN architectures, using standard evaluation metrics. The authors should also provide detailed information about the implementation of the compared methods, including hyperparameter settings and training procedures. This would allow for a fair and accurate comparison of the proposed method with existing approaches. Fourth, the authors should incorporate standard evaluation metrics for generative models, such as the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and the Inception Score (IS). These metrics are widely used in the literature and would provide a more objective assessment of the sample quality and diversity achieved by the proposed method. The authors should also provide more detailed visualizations of the generated samples, including comparisons with samples from other methods. This would help to qualitatively assess the sample quality and diversity. Fifth, the authors should provide more detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. This includes the size of the datasets, the number of training and testing samples, and any preprocessing steps applied. They should also provide more details about the training process, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs. This would improve the reproducibility of their results and allow other researchers to build upon their work. Sixth, the authors should conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of their method, such as the discriminator architecture and the adversarial loss function. This would help to understand the contribution of each component to the overall performance of the method. Finally, the authors should apply their method to real-world applications, such as image synthesis tasks, to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method. This would involve not only generating samples but also evaluating the performance of the model in a practical context. By addressing these weaknesses, the authors can significantly strengthen their paper and demonstrate the true potential of their proposed method. These suggestions are directly connected to the identified weaknesses and provide a clear path for improving the paper's quality and impact.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, several key questions arise that warrant further clarification. First, how does the proposed method perform compared to other state-of-the-art diffusion models and GANs, particularly on complex datasets? The paper's current evaluation is limited to a baseline diffusion model on simple 2D datasets, and it lacks a comparison with other established generative models. Providing a quantitative comparison using standard metrics like FID and IS would be crucial to understand the relative performance of the proposed method. Second, how does the proposed method perform on meaningful real-world applications? The paper focuses solely on generating samples on simple 2D datasets, and there is no demonstration of the method's effectiveness in practical tasks such as image synthesis or data augmentation. Applying the method to real-world applications would provide a more compelling validation of its practical significance. Third, what is the impact of different discriminator architectures and adversarial loss functions on the performance of the proposed method? The paper uses a simple MLP architecture for the discriminator and a basic adversarial loss. Exploring more sophisticated discriminator architectures and loss functions could potentially lead to further improvements in sample quality and diversity. Fourth, what are the computational costs associated with the proposed method, and how does it compare to other diffusion models and GANs in terms of training time and resource requirements? The paper provides training time as one of the evaluation metrics, but a more detailed analysis of the computational costs would be beneficial. Fifth, how does the gradient penalty affect the training stability and sample quality of the proposed method? The paper introduces a gradient penalty to stabilize the training process, but a more detailed analysis of its impact would be valuable. Sixth, what are the limitations of the proposed method, and under what conditions does it perform well or poorly? A more thorough discussion of the limitations of the method would provide a more balanced assessment of its strengths and weaknesses. These questions target core methodological choices and critical assumptions, and seeking clarification on these points would significantly enhance the understanding and impact of the paper.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n4.0\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

While the idea of combining diffusion models and GANs is interesting, the implementation here appears to be a straightforward addition of a discriminator to a diffusion model without any significant architectural or methodological innovation. The authors should explore more sophisticated ways of integrating GANs into the diffusion framework, such as using the discriminator to guide the diffusion process itself, rather than just using it as a final quality check.

This includes the size of the datasets, the number of training and testing samples, and any preprocessing steps applied. The authors should also provide more details about the training process, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs. Furthermore, the authors should provide more comprehensive evaluation metrics, such as the Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which are widely used to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated samples. The authors should also provide ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of their method, such as the discriminator architecture and the adversarial loss function. This would help to understand the contribution of each component to the overall performance of the method.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. How does the proposed method perform compared to other diffusion models and GANs? The authors should compare their method with other diffusion models and GANs, and provide FID and IS scores [1,2] to evaluate the sample quality and diversity.\n\n2.

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a hybrid generative model that combines the strengths of diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The core idea is to enhance the sample quality and diversity of diffusion models by incorporating a discriminator network, a key component of GANs. Specifically, the authors integrate a discriminator into the diffusion framework, which distinguishes between real and generated samples. The diffusion model's denoiser network is then modified to include an adversarial loss term, alongside the standard reconstruction loss, aiming to improve the fidelity of generated samples. To stabilize the training process, a gradient penalty is also introduced. The authors evaluate their proposed method on several simple 2D datasets, including Circle, Dino, Line, and Moons, and compare the results against a baseline diffusion model without GAN components. The evaluation metrics used include training time, evaluation loss, KL divergence, and a qualitative assessment of sample quality. The results suggest that the GAN-enhanced diffusion model achieves improvements in sample quality and diversity compared to the baseline. However, the paper does not explore comparisons with other state-of-the-art diffusion models or GANs, nor does it apply the method to more complex, real-world datasets. The primary contribution of this work lies in the integration of a discriminator into a diffusion model and the empirical demonstration of its impact on sample quality in a simplified setting. However, the paper's limitations, particularly in the scope of its experimental validation, restrict the generalizability and practical applicability of its findings. The paper's focus is primarily on demonstrating the feasibility of the hybrid approach, rather than achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex tasks. The authors acknowledge the need for future work to extend the model to higher-dimensional data and more complex datasets, indicating a clear understanding of the current limitations of their approach. The paper provides a foundational exploration of GAN-diffusion hybrids, but requires further development to realize its full potential.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n1.5\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nWhile the paper has several limitations, it does present some notable strengths. The core strength lies in the clear and straightforward integration of a GAN framework into a diffusion model. The authors successfully demonstrate that adding a discriminator network and an adversarial loss to the diffusion model's training process can lead to improvements in sample quality and diversity, at least on the simple 2D datasets considered. The method is clearly described, and the rationale behind each component, such as the discriminator network, the modified denoiser, and the gradient penalty, is well-articulated. The paper provides a detailed explanation of the architecture of the denoiser and discriminator networks, the loss functions used, and the training procedure. This clarity makes the paper accessible and easy to follow. The authors also provide a qualitative assessment of the generated samples, which, while not as rigorous as quantitative metrics like FID or IS, does offer some visual evidence of the improvements achieved by their method. The paper's focus on a foundational exploration of GAN-diffusion hybrids is a valuable contribution, as it provides a starting point for future research in this area. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their work and suggest directions for future research, such as exploring more complex discriminator architectures, extending the model to higher-dimensional data, and investigating the impact of different adversarial loss functions. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the current state of their work and its potential for future development. The paper's experimental setup, while limited, is well-defined and allows for a clear evaluation of the proposed method against a baseline diffusion model. The use of simple 2D datasets, though a limitation, allows for a clear visualization of the generated samples and facilitates the analysis of the model's behavior. The paper's focus on the fundamental behavior of GAN-enhanced diffusion in low-dimensional spaces is a valuable contribution, as it allows for a better understanding of the interaction between the components. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its clear presentation of a novel approach, its successful demonstration of the feasibility of integrating GANs into diffusion models, and its identification of promising directions for future research.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nThe paper suffers from several significant weaknesses that limit its impact and generalizability. The most prominent weakness is the limited novelty of the proposed method. As I have verified, the core idea of adding a discriminator to a diffusion model is not entirely new, and the paper does not introduce any significant architectural or methodological innovations in this regard. The authors themselves describe the method as an integration of a GAN framework into a diffusion model, which involves implementing a discriminator network and modifying the denoiser to include an adversarial loss term. This approach, while effective in principle, lacks substantial novelty compared to existing GAN-diffusion hybrid models. The paper's experimental setup is also a major weakness. The authors evaluate their method solely on simple 2D datasets, such as Circle, Dino, Line, and Moons. These datasets are not representative of the complexity of real-world data, and the results obtained on these datasets may not generalize to more challenging scenarios. The lack of evaluation on more complex datasets, such as image datasets like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, significantly limits the practical relevance of the findings. Furthermore, the paper does not compare the proposed method with other state-of-the-art diffusion models or GANs. The baseline used in the experiments is a standard diffusion model without GAN components, which is not sufficient to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The absence of comparisons with other established generative models makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed method. The evaluation metrics used in the paper are also limited. The authors rely on training time, evaluation loss, KL divergence, and a qualitative assessment of sample quality. They do not use standard metrics for evaluating generative models, such as the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) or the Inception Score (IS). The absence of these metrics makes it difficult to compare the performance of the proposed method with other generative models in the literature. The paper also lacks sufficient details about the compared methods and the datasets used. The description of the baseline diffusion model is brief, and the paper does not provide specific architectural or training details. Similarly, the descriptions of the datasets are high-level, lacking details about the data generation process or potential noise. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results and to fully understand the experimental setup. The absence of detailed visualizations of the generated samples, particularly comparative visualizations with the baseline, further hinders a thorough assessment of the method's performance. Finally, the paper does not apply the proposed method to any real-world applications. The focus is solely on generating samples on simple 2D datasets, and there is no demonstration of the method's effectiveness in practical tasks such as image synthesis or data augmentation. This lack of application to real-world problems limits the practical significance of the findings. In summary, the paper's weaknesses, including limited novelty, weak experimental setup, lack of comparison with other models, limited evaluation metrics, insufficient details, and lack of real-world applications, significantly undermine its overall contribution and impact. My confidence in these identified limitations is high, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and the absence of crucial elements in its methodology and experimental design.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete and actionable improvements. First, the authors should explore more sophisticated ways of integrating GANs into the diffusion framework. Instead of simply adding a discriminator and an adversarial loss, they could investigate using the discriminator to guide the diffusion process itself, perhaps by incorporating discriminator feedback into the denoising steps or using the discriminator's feature space to inform the diffusion model's training. This would require a more in-depth architectural and methodological innovation, moving beyond a straightforward combination of existing components. Second, the authors must significantly expand their experimental evaluation. This includes evaluating their method on more complex and diverse datasets, such as image datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, or ImageNet. These datasets are standard benchmarks for generative models and would provide a more rigorous assessment of the method's capabilities. Furthermore, the authors should evaluate their method on datasets from other domains, such as audio or time-series data, to demonstrate its broader applicability. Third, a thorough comparison with existing state-of-the-art diffusion models and GANs is crucial. This would involve comparing the proposed method against models like DDPM, ScoreSDE, and various GAN architectures, using standard evaluation metrics. The authors should also provide detailed information about the implementation of the compared methods, including hyperparameter settings and training procedures. This would allow for a fair and accurate comparison of the proposed method with existing approaches. Fourth, the authors should incorporate standard evaluation metrics for generative models, such as the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and the Inception Score (IS). These metrics are widely used in the literature and would provide a more objective assessment of the sample quality and diversity achieved by the proposed method. The authors should also provide more detailed visualizations of the generated samples, including comparisons with samples from other methods. This would help to qualitatively assess the sample quality and diversity. Fifth, the authors should provide more detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. This includes the size of the datasets, the number of training and testing samples, and any preprocessing steps applied. They should also provide more details about the training process, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs. This would improve the reproducibility of their results and allow other researchers to build upon their work. Sixth, the authors should conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of their method, such as the discriminator architecture and the adversarial loss function. This would help to understand the contribution of each component to the overall performance of the method. Finally, the authors should apply their method to real-world applications, such as image synthesis tasks, to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method. This would involve not only generating samples but also evaluating the performance of the model in a practical context. By addressing these weaknesses, the authors can significantly strengthen their paper and demonstrate the true potential of their proposed method. These suggestions are directly connected to the identified weaknesses and provide a clear path for improving the paper's quality and impact.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, several key questions arise that warrant further clarification. First, how does the proposed method perform compared to other state-of-the-art diffusion models and GANs, particularly on complex datasets? The paper's current evaluation is limited to a baseline diffusion model on simple 2D datasets, and it lacks a comparison with other established generative models. Providing a quantitative comparison using standard metrics like FID and IS would be crucial to understand the relative performance of the proposed method. Second, how does the proposed method perform on meaningful real-world applications? The paper focuses solely on generating samples on simple 2D datasets, and there is no demonstration of the method's effectiveness in practical tasks such as image synthesis or data augmentation. Applying the method to real-world applications would provide a more compelling validation of its practical significance. Third, what is the impact of different discriminator architectures and adversarial loss functions on the performance of the proposed method? The paper uses a simple MLP architecture for the discriminator and a basic adversarial loss. Exploring more sophisticated discriminator architectures and loss functions could potentially lead to further improvements in sample quality and diversity. Fourth, what are the computational costs associated with the proposed method, and how does it compare to other diffusion models and GANs in terms of training time and resource requirements? The paper provides training time as one of the evaluation metrics, but a more detailed analysis of the computational costs would be beneficial. Fifth, how does the gradient penalty affect the training stability and sample quality of the proposed method? The paper introduces a gradient penalty to stabilize the training process, but a more detailed analysis of its impact would be valuable. Sixth, what are the limitations of the proposed method, and under what conditions does it perform well or poorly? A more thorough discussion of the limitations of the method would provide a more balanced assessment of its strengths and weaknesses. These questions target core methodological choices and critical assumptions, and seeking clarification on these points would significantly enhance the understanding and impact of the paper.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n4.0\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",

It would be valuable to explore if the two expert networks are sufficient to capture the diversity of modes in higher dimensions, or if a more complex architecture with a greater number of experts would be necessary. Furthermore, the authors should consider the computational implications of increasing the number of experts, and discuss potential strategies for mitigating the increased computational burden.

This would help to determine whether the complexity of the MLP gating network is justified by the performance gains, or if a simpler approach could achieve comparable results with lower computational cost.

It would be helpful to provide a breakdown of the computational costs associated with each component of the architecture, such as the expert networks and the gating mechanism. This would allow readers to better understand the trade-offs between performance gains and increased computational requirements. Furthermore, the authors should explore potential optimization techniques for reducing the computational overhead of DualDiff, such as model compression or knowledge distillation.

While the authors acknowledge a 25-40% increase in training time, they should also discuss the impact on memory usage and inference time. It would be helpful to provide a breakdown of the computational costs associated with each component of the architecture, such as the expert networks and the gating mechanism. This would allow readers to better understand the trade-offs between performance gains and increased computational requirements.

The authors address the challenge of accurately capturing multiple modes in low-dimensional data, which is often difficult for traditional single-network denoisers. The proposed approach employs two specialized expert networks combined through a gating mechanism, allowing for more flexible modeling of complex, multi-modal distributions. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in mode capture and sample diversity on various 2D datasets, with a notable reduction in KL divergence.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3\n\n### Presentation\n\n3\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The authors clearly articulate the problem, their proposed solution, and the experimental results. The figures and tables are helpful in understanding the performance improvements.\n2. The proposed dual-expert architecture is a novel approach to addressing the limitations of single-network denoisers in low-dimensional settings. The dynamic gating mechanism is an interesting design choice that allows the model to adaptively combine the outputs of the two experts.\n3. The authors conduct extensive experiments on various 2D datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach. The quantitative results, such as the reduction in KL divergence, and the qualitative assessments of generated samples provide strong evidence for the improvements achieved by DualDiff.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The experiments are primarily conducted on 2D datasets. While these results are promising, it is unclear how well the proposed method would scale to higher-dimensional data. The authors should provide more discussion on the potential challenges and solutions for applying DualDiff to higher-dimensional spaces. Specifically, the paper lacks a discussion on how the gating mechanism would behave with increased dimensionality. Would the gating network still be able to effectively combine the outputs of the two experts, or would it become overwhelmed by the increased input space? Furthermore, the computational cost of the gating mechanism and the two expert networks should be analyzed in the context of higher dimensions. \n2. The paper does not provide a thorough ablation study on the impact of different components of the proposed architecture. For example, it would be beneficial to see how the performance changes when using only one expert network or when removing the dynamic gating mechanism. It is also unclear how the two expert networks are initialized and whether they converge to specialize in different modes or if they simply learn the same representation. A more detailed analysis of the individual expert network's learned representations would be beneficial.\n3. The paper does not discuss the sensitivity of the proposed method to hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, and the architecture of the expert networks. Providing this information would help in understanding the robustness of the method and its ease of use. Specifically, the paper should include a sensitivity analysis of the gating network's architecture and the impact of different activation functions. It is also unclear how the choice of the number of layers in the expert networks affects the performance and whether there is a point of diminishing returns.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit from a more detailed analysis of the gating mechanism's behavior, especially in the context of higher-dimensional data. The authors should investigate how the gating network's performance scales with increasing input dimensionality and whether the gating mechanism can still effectively combine the outputs of the two experts. This could involve visualizing the gating weights for different inputs and analyzing the correlation between the input features and the gating weights. Furthermore, the authors should explore different architectures for the gating network, such as using convolutional layers or attention mechanisms, to see if they can improve the scalability of the method. It would also be beneficial to analyze the computational cost of the gating mechanism and the two expert networks in higher dimensions and discuss potential optimization strategies.\n\nTo strengthen the ablation study, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the individual expert networks' learned representations. This could involve visualizing the feature maps of the expert networks or using techniques like t-SNE to project the high-dimensional representations into a lower-dimensional space. This would help to understand whether the two experts are indeed learning different modes of the data distribution. The authors should also investigate the impact of different initialization strategies for the expert networks and analyze how they affect the specialization of the experts. Furthermore, the ablation study should include experiments with different combinations of expert networks, such as using one expert network with a linear combination or a simple averaging of the outputs. This would help to isolate the contribution of the dynamic gating mechanism.\n\nFinally, the paper should include a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameters. This should include not only the learning rate and batch size but also the architecture of the expert networks, the gating network, and the activation functions. The authors should explore the impact of different numbers of layers in the expert networks and analyze whether there is a point of diminishing returns. They should also investigate the sensitivity of the method to the choice of optimizer and the learning rate schedule. This analysis should be presented in a clear and concise manner, with tables and figures that summarize the results. This would help to understand the robustness of the method and its ease of use and provide practical guidance for users who want to apply the method to their own problems.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease refer to the Weaknesses section.\n\n### Rating\n\n5\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 4\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper introduces DualDiff, a novel dual-expert denoising architecture designed to enhance the performance of diffusion models on low-dimensional datasets.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces DualDiff, a novel dual-expert denoising architecture designed to enhance the performance of diffusion models, particularly in low-dimensional data settings where capturing multi-modal distributions is challenging. The core idea revolves around employing two specialized expert networks, each potentially focusing on different modes of the data distribution, and dynamically combining their outputs using a gating mechanism. This gating mechanism, implemented as a separate multi-layer perceptron (MLP), takes the same input as the expert networks and outputs a scalar value between 0 and 1, effectively determining the weight assigned to each expert's prediction. The authors also introduce a diversity loss term to further encourage the model to capture multiple modes in the data distribution. The method is evaluated on a range of datasets, including 2D synthetic datasets (circle, dino, line, moons), MNIST, and CIFAR-10. The empirical results demonstrate that DualDiff achieves significant improvements in mode capture and sample diversity compared to traditional single-network denoisers, as evidenced by a notable reduction in KL divergence. Specifically, the paper reports a 38.7% reduction in KL divergence on the complex 'dino' dataset. The authors also present ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of their architecture, such as enhanced gating and increased capacity of the expert networks. The paper concludes by acknowledging the limitations of the current approach, particularly the diminishing returns in high-dimensional spaces and the increased computational costs, and suggests future research directions, including investigating the scalability of the dual-expert architecture to higher-dimensional spaces and exploring adaptive expert counts based on data complexity. Overall, the paper presents a compelling approach to addressing the limitations of single-expert diffusion models in low-dimensional settings, with clear empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed dual-expert architecture and diversity loss. The work highlights the potential of specialized architectures for improving diffusion models in challenging data scenarios, opening new avenues for applications in scientific simulation and data analysis.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nI find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. The core contribution, the DualDiff architecture, is a novel and creative approach to addressing the limitations of single-expert diffusion models in low-dimensional settings. The idea of using two specialized expert networks, combined through a dynamic gating mechanism, is a compelling way to tackle the challenge of capturing multi-modal distributions. This is a significant departure from traditional single-network denoisers and demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem space. The introduction of a diversity loss term further enhances the model's ability to capture multiple modes, which is a crucial aspect of generative modeling. The paper also provides clear and detailed explanations of the methodology, including the architecture of the expert networks, the gating mechanism, and the training process. The use of visual aids and quantitative metrics, such as KL divergence, helps in understanding the improvements achieved by DualDiff. The empirical results are compelling, demonstrating significant improvements in mode capture and sample diversity on various 2D datasets. The reported 38.7% reduction in KL divergence on the 'dino' dataset is particularly impressive. The inclusion of ablation studies, while not exhaustive, provides valuable insights into the impact of different components of the architecture. The authors also acknowledge the limitations of their approach and suggest future research directions, which is a sign of good scientific practice. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the motivation, methodology, and experimental results. The authors have also made their code available, which is a significant contribution to the community and will facilitate further research in this area. Overall, the paper presents a well-executed study with a novel and effective approach to improving diffusion models in low-dimensional settings. The combination of a dual-expert architecture, a dynamic gating mechanism, and a diversity loss term represents a significant advancement in the field.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. Firstly, the experiments are primarily conducted on 2D datasets, which raises significant questions about the scalability of the approach to higher-dimensional spaces. While the paper includes results on MNIST and CIFAR-10, the analysis and discussion primarily focus on the 2D datasets. The authors themselves acknowledge the 'diminishing returns in high-dimensional spaces' in the 'CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK' section, and the 'SCALABILITY ANALYSIS' section only briefly mentions that the relative improvement decreases for higher dimensions. This lack of thorough exploration of higher-dimensional data is a major limitation, as it is unclear whether the proposed dual-expert architecture and gating mechanism would be as effective in more complex, high-dimensional scenarios. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on how the gating mechanism would behave with increased dimensionality. Would the gating network still be able to effectively combine the outputs of the two experts, or would it become overwhelmed by the increased input space? Furthermore, the computational cost of the gating mechanism and the two expert networks should be analyzed in the context of higher dimensions. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with each component of the architecture, such as the expert networks and the gating mechanism. While the 'COMPUTATIONAL COSTS' section states that the dual-expert architecture adds 38% more parameters, 25-40% longer training time, and 15-30% higher memory usage compared to a single-expert model, it does not provide a breakdown of these costs per component. This lack of granularity makes it difficult to assess the trade-offs between performance gains and increased computational requirements. The paper also lacks a thorough exploration of the impact of different architectural choices for the expert networks and the gating mechanism. While the 'METHOD' section describes the expert networks as 'multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with residual connections' and the gating network as a 'separate MLP', it lacks specific details about the number of layers, width, or activation functions used in these MLPs. The 'ABLATION STUDY' section includes variations like 'Enhanced Gating' and 'Increased Capacity', suggesting some exploration of architectural choices, but the specifics of these enhancements are not detailed in the 'METHOD' section. There is no ablation study comparing the MLP gating mechanism to simpler alternatives, such as a linear combination based on input features or a static weighting scheme. This makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the proposed method to different architectural choices. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the sensitivity of the model to the initialization of the expert networks and the gating mechanism. The paper also does not provide a thorough ablation study on the impact of different components of the proposed architecture. For example, it would be beneficial to see how the performance changes when using only one expert network or when removing the dynamic gating mechanism. While the 'ABLATION STUDY' section includes results for 'Baseline', 'Dual-Expert', 'Enhanced Gating', 'Increased Capacity', and 'With Diversity Loss', there is no ablation study explicitly comparing the dual-expert model to a single-expert model with the same capacity as one of the experts, or a model without the dynamic gating mechanism (e.g., a simple average of the two experts). It is also unclear how the two expert networks are initialized and whether they converge to specialize in different modes or if they simply learn the same representation. A more detailed analysis of the individual expert network's learned representations would be beneficial. Finally, the paper does not discuss the sensitivity of the proposed method to hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, and the architecture of the expert networks. The 'EXPERIMENTAL SETUP' section mentions the learning rate (3 × 10^-4), batch size (256), and the use of AdamW optimizer, but there is no dedicated section or experiments analyzing the sensitivity of the method to these hyperparameters or the architecture of the expert and gating networks (e.g., number of layers, activation functions). The 'ABLATION STUDY' includes 'Enhanced Gating' and 'Increased Capacity', which touch upon architectural changes, but do not systematically explore the sensitivity to various hyperparameters or architectural choices. These limitations, which I have verified through direct examination of the paper, significantly impact the generalizability and robustness of the proposed method.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. Firstly, the paper would greatly benefit from a more detailed investigation into the scalability of the proposed DualDiff architecture to higher-dimensional data. While the current results on 2D datasets are promising, it is crucial to understand how the method would perform in more complex scenarios. Specifically, the authors should explore the behavior of the gating mechanism with increased dimensionality. It is not clear if the current gating mechanism would be able to effectively combine the outputs of the two expert networks in higher-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, the authors should investigate whether two expert networks are sufficient to capture the complexity of higher-dimensional distributions, or if more experts would be necessary. It would also be beneficial to analyze the computational cost of training and inference with multiple expert networks, as this could be a limiting factor for practical applications. The authors should consider providing a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of their method, and compare it to the complexity of single-expert models. To enhance the robustness of the proposed method, the authors should conduct a more thorough ablation study on the architectural choices for the expert networks and the gating mechanism. This should include exploring different network depths and widths for the expert networks, as well as alternative gating mechanisms. For example, the authors could investigate the impact of using convolutional layers in the expert networks, or explore different activation functions. They could also consider using a more complex gating mechanism, such as a neural network, instead of the current approach. This would help to determine the optimal architectural choices for the proposed method, and to assess its sensitivity to different design decisions. The ablation study should also include an analysis of the impact of the diversity loss term on the performance of the model. The paper should also provide a more detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with the dual-expert architecture. While the authors mention a 25-40% increase in training time, they should also provide a more detailed analysis of the memory requirements of the method. This is particularly important for higher-dimensional data, where memory limitations could be a significant constraint. The authors should also discuss the trade-offs between performance gains and increased computational requirements in more detail. For example, they could investigate whether it is possible to achieve similar performance gains with a single expert network by increasing its capacity, or by using a different training strategy. This would help to determine whether the proposed method is a practical solution for real-world applications. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the gating mechanism's behavior, especially in the context of higher-dimensional data. The authors should investigate how the gating network's performance scales with increasing input dimensionality and whether the gating mechanism can still effectively combine the outputs of the two experts. This could involve visualizing the gating weights for different inputs and analyzing the correlation between the input features and the gating weights. Furthermore, the authors should explore different architectures for the gating network, such as using convolutional layers or attention mechanisms, to see if they can improve the scalability of the method. It would also be beneficial to analyze the computational cost of the gating mechanism and the two expert networks in higher dimensions and discuss potential optimization strategies. To strengthen the ablation study, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the individual expert networks' learned representations. This could involve visualizing the feature maps of the expert networks or using techniques like t-SNE to project the high-dimensional representations into a lower-dimensional space. This would help to understand whether the two experts are indeed learning different modes of the data distribution. The authors should also investigate the impact of different initialization strategies for the expert networks and analyze how they affect the specialization of the experts. Furthermore, the ablation study should include experiments with different combinations of expert networks, such as using one expert network with a linear combination or a simple averaging of the outputs. This would help to isolate the contribution of the dynamic gating mechanism. Finally, the paper should include a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameters. This should include not only the learning rate and batch size but also the architecture of the expert networks, the gating network, and the activation functions. The authors should explore the impact of different numbers of layers in the expert networks and analyze whether there is a point of diminishing returns. They should also investigate the sensitivity of the method to the choice of optimizer and the learning rate schedule. This analysis should be presented in a clear and concise manner, with tables and figures that summarize the results. This would help to understand the robustness of the method and its ease of use and provide practical guidance for users who want to apply the method to their own problems.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nI have several questions that arise from my analysis of this paper. Firstly, how does the performance of DualDiff scale with the dimensionality of the data? While the paper includes results on MNIST and CIFAR-10, the analysis primarily focuses on 2D datasets. Are there any preliminary results or insights on its effectiveness in higher-dimensional spaces, beyond what is presented in the 'SCALABILITY ANALYSIS' section? Secondly, what is the impact of different architectural choices for the expert networks and the gating mechanism on the overall performance? The paper mentions that the expert networks are MLPs with residual connections and the gating network is a separate MLP, but it lacks specific details about the number of layers, width, or activation functions used. Could the authors provide more details on these architectural choices and their impact on the model's performance? Specifically, how does the performance change when using different network depths, widths, and activation functions for the expert networks, and what is the impact of using different gating mechanisms, such as a linear combination or a static weighting scheme? Thirdly, can the authors provide more details on the computational overhead introduced by the dual-expert architecture and discuss potential optimizations? The paper mentions a 25-40% increase in training time, but it lacks a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with each component of the architecture, such as the expert networks and the gating mechanism. What is the impact on memory usage and inference time, and are there any potential optimization techniques for reducing the computational overhead of DualDiff, such as model compression or knowledge distillation? Finally, in the introduction, the authors mention the potential for informing improvements in higher-dimensional domains. Could the authors elaborate on specific insights from DualDiff that could be applied to higher-dimensional diffusion models? What specific aspects of the dual-expert architecture or the diversity loss term could be beneficial in more complex, high-dimensional scenarios? These questions are crucial for understanding the limitations and potential of the proposed method and for guiding future research in this area.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n4.25\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces DualDiff, a novel dual-expert denoising architecture designed to enhance the performance of diffusion models, particularly in low-dimensional data settings where capturing multi-modal distributions is challenging. The core idea revolves around employing two specialized expert networks, each potentially focusing on different modes of the data distribution, and dynamically combining their outputs using a gating mechanism. This gating mechanism, implemented as a separate multi-layer perceptron (MLP), takes the same input as the expert networks and outputs a scalar value between 0 and 1, effectively determining the weight assigned to each expert's prediction. The authors also introduce a diversity loss term to further encourage the model to capture multiple modes in the data distribution. The method is evaluated on a range of datasets, including 2D synthetic datasets (circle, dino, line, moons), MNIST, and CIFAR-10. The empirical results demonstrate that DualDiff achieves significant improvements in mode capture and sample diversity compared to traditional single-network denoisers, as evidenced by a notable reduction in KL divergence. Specifically, the paper reports a 38.7% reduction in KL divergence on the complex 'dino' dataset. The authors also present ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of their architecture, such as enhanced gating and increased capacity of the expert networks. The paper concludes by acknowledging the limitations of the current approach, particularly the diminishing returns in high-dimensional spaces and the increased computational costs, and suggests future research directions, including investigating the scalability of the dual-expert architecture to higher-dimensional spaces and exploring adaptive expert counts based on data complexity. Overall, the paper presents a compelling approach to addressing the limitations of single-expert diffusion models in low-dimensional settings, with clear empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed dual-expert architecture and diversity loss. The work highlights the potential of specialized architectures for improving diffusion models in challenging data scenarios, opening new avenues for applications in scientific simulation and data analysis.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.25\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nI find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. The core contribution, the DualDiff architecture, is a novel and creative approach to addressing the limitations of single-expert diffusion models in low-dimensional settings. The idea of using two specialized expert networks, combined through a dynamic gating mechanism, is a compelling way to tackle the challenge of capturing multi-modal distributions. This is a significant departure from traditional single-network denoisers and demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem space. The introduction of a diversity loss term further enhances the model's ability to capture multiple modes, which is a crucial aspect of generative modeling. The paper also provides clear and detailed explanations of the methodology, including the architecture of the expert networks, the gating mechanism, and the training process. The use of visual aids and quantitative metrics, such as KL divergence, helps in understanding the improvements achieved by DualDiff. The empirical results are compelling, demonstrating significant improvements in mode capture and sample diversity on various 2D datasets. The reported 38.7% reduction in KL divergence on the 'dino' dataset is particularly impressive. The inclusion of ablation studies, while not exhaustive, provides valuable insights into the impact of different components of the architecture. The authors also acknowledge the limitations of their approach and suggest future research directions, which is a sign of good scientific practice. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the motivation, methodology, and experimental results. The authors have also made their code available, which is a significant contribution to the community and will facilitate further research in this area. Overall, the paper presents a well-executed study with a novel and effective approach to improving diffusion models in low-dimensional settings. The combination of a dual-expert architecture, a dynamic gating mechanism, and a diversity loss term represents a significant advancement in the field.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. Firstly, the experiments are primarily conducted on 2D datasets, which raises significant questions about the scalability of the approach to higher-dimensional spaces. While the paper includes results on MNIST and CIFAR-10, the analysis and discussion primarily focus on the 2D datasets. The authors themselves acknowledge the 'diminishing returns in high-dimensional spaces' in the 'CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK' section, and the 'SCALABILITY ANALYSIS' section only briefly mentions that the relative improvement decreases for higher dimensions. This lack of thorough exploration of higher-dimensional data is a major limitation, as it is unclear whether the proposed dual-expert architecture and gating mechanism would be as effective in more complex, high-dimensional scenarios. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on how the gating mechanism would behave with increased dimensionality. Would the gating network still be able to effectively combine the outputs of the two experts, or would it become overwhelmed by the increased input space? Furthermore, the computational cost of the gating mechanism and the two expert networks should be analyzed in the context of higher dimensions. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with each component of the architecture, such as the expert networks and the gating mechanism. While the 'COMPUTATIONAL COSTS' section states that the dual-expert architecture adds 38% more parameters, 25-40% longer training time, and 15-30% higher memory usage compared to a single-expert model, it does not provide a breakdown of these costs per component. This lack of granularity makes it difficult to assess the trade-offs between performance gains and increased computational requirements. The paper also lacks a thorough exploration of the impact of different architectural choices for the expert networks and the gating mechanism. While the 'METHOD' section describes the expert networks as 'multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with residual connections' and the gating network as a 'separate MLP', it lacks specific details about the number of layers, width, or activation functions used in these MLPs. The 'ABLATION STUDY' section includes variations like 'Enhanced Gating' and 'Increased Capacity', suggesting some exploration of architectural choices, but the specifics of these enhancements are not detailed in the 'METHOD' section. There is no ablation study comparing the MLP gating mechanism to simpler alternatives, such as a linear combination based on input features or a static weighting scheme. This makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the proposed method to different architectural choices. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the sensitivity of the model to the initialization of the expert networks and the gating mechanism. The paper also does not provide a thorough ablation study on the impact of different components of the proposed architecture. For example, it would be beneficial to see how the performance changes when using only one expert network or when removing the dynamic gating mechanism. While the 'ABLATION STUDY' section includes results for 'Baseline', 'Dual-Expert', 'Enhanced Gating', 'Increased Capacity', and 'With Diversity Loss', there is no ablation study explicitly comparing the dual-expert model to a single-expert model with the same capacity as one of the experts, or a model without the dynamic gating mechanism (e.g., a simple average of the two experts). It is also unclear how the two expert networks are initialized and whether they converge to specialize in different modes or if they simply learn the same representation. A more detailed analysis of the individual expert network's learned representations would be beneficial. Finally, the paper does not discuss the sensitivity of the proposed method to hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, and the architecture of the expert networks. The 'EXPERIMENTAL SETUP' section mentions the learning rate (3 × 10^-4), batch size (256), and the use of AdamW optimizer, but there is no dedicated section or experiments analyzing the sensitivity of the method to these hyperparameters or the architecture of the expert and gating networks (e.g., number of layers, activation functions). The 'ABLATION STUDY' includes 'Enhanced Gating' and 'Increased Capacity', which touch upon architectural changes, but do not systematically explore the sensitivity to various hyperparameters or architectural choices. These limitations, which I have verified through direct examination of the paper, significantly impact the generalizability and robustness of the proposed method.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. Firstly, the paper would greatly benefit from a more detailed investigation into the scalability of the proposed DualDiff architecture to higher-dimensional data. While the current results on 2D datasets are promising, it is crucial to understand how the method would perform in more complex scenarios. Specifically, the authors should explore the behavior of the gating mechanism with increased dimensionality. It is not clear if the current gating mechanism would be able to effectively combine the outputs of the two expert networks in higher-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, the authors should investigate whether two expert networks are sufficient to capture the complexity of higher-dimensional distributions, or if more experts would be necessary. It would also be beneficial to analyze the computational cost of training and inference with multiple expert networks, as this could be a limiting factor for practical applications. The authors should consider providing a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of their method, and compare it to the complexity of single-expert models. To enhance the robustness of the proposed method, the authors should conduct a more thorough ablation study on the architectural choices for the expert networks and the gating mechanism. This should include exploring different network depths and widths for the expert networks, as well as alternative gating mechanisms. For example, the authors could investigate the impact of using convolutional layers in the expert networks, or explore different activation functions. They could also consider using a more complex gating mechanism, such as a neural network, instead of the current approach. This would help to determine the optimal architectural choices for the proposed method, and to assess its sensitivity to different design decisions. The ablation study should also include an analysis of the impact of the diversity loss term on the performance of the model. The paper should also provide a more detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with the dual-expert architecture. While the authors mention a 25-40% increase in training time, they should also provide a more detailed analysis of the memory requirements of the method. This is particularly important for higher-dimensional data, where memory limitations could be a significant constraint. The authors should also discuss the trade-offs between performance gains and increased computational requirements in more detail. For example, they could investigate whether it is possible to achieve similar performance gains with a single expert network by increasing its capacity, or by using a different training strategy. This would help to determine whether the proposed method is a practical solution for real-world applications. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the gating mechanism's behavior, especially in the context of higher-dimensional data. The authors should investigate how the gating network's performance scales with increasing input dimensionality and whether the gating mechanism can still effectively combine the outputs of the two experts. This could involve visualizing the gating weights for different inputs and analyzing the correlation between the input features and the gating weights. Furthermore, the authors should explore different architectures for the gating network, such as using convolutional layers or attention mechanisms, to see if they can improve the scalability of the method. It would also be beneficial to analyze the computational cost of the gating mechanism and the two expert networks in higher dimensions and discuss potential optimization strategies. To strengthen the ablation study, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the individual expert networks' learned representations. This could involve visualizing the feature maps of the expert networks or using techniques like t-SNE to project the high-dimensional representations into a lower-dimensional space. This would help to understand whether the two experts are indeed learning different modes of the data distribution. The authors should also investigate the impact of different initialization strategies for the expert networks and analyze how they affect the specialization of the experts. Furthermore, the ablation study should include experiments with different combinations of expert networks, such as using one expert network with a linear combination or a simple averaging of the outputs. This would help to isolate the contribution of the dynamic gating mechanism. Finally, the paper should include a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameters. This should include not only the learning rate and batch size but also the architecture of the expert networks, the gating network, and the activation functions. The authors should explore the impact of different numbers of layers in the expert networks and analyze whether there is a point of diminishing returns. They should also investigate the sensitivity of the method to the choice of optimizer and the learning rate schedule. This analysis should be presented in a clear and concise manner, with tables and figures that summarize the results. This would help to understand the robustness of the method and its ease of use and provide practical guidance for users who want to apply the method to their own problems.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nI have several questions that arise from my analysis of this paper. Firstly, how does the performance of DualDiff scale with the dimensionality of the data? While the paper includes results on MNIST and CIFAR-10, the analysis primarily focuses on 2D datasets. Are there any preliminary results or insights on its effectiveness in higher-dimensional spaces, beyond what is presented in the 'SCALABILITY ANALYSIS' section? Secondly, what is the impact of different architectural choices for the expert networks and the gating mechanism on the overall performance? The paper mentions that the expert networks are MLPs with residual connections and the gating network is a separate MLP, but it lacks specific details about the number of layers, width, or activation functions used. Could the authors provide more details on these architectural choices and their impact on the model's performance? Specifically, how does the performance change when using different network depths, widths, and activation functions for the expert networks, and what is the impact of using different gating mechanisms, such as a linear combination or a static weighting scheme? Thirdly, can the authors provide more details on the computational overhead introduced by the dual-expert architecture and discuss potential optimizations? The paper mentions a 25-40% increase in training time, but it lacks a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with each component of the architecture, such as the expert networks and the gating mechanism. What is the impact on memory usage and inference time, and are there any potential optimization techniques for reducing the computational overhead of DualDiff, such as model compression or knowledge distillation? Finally, in the introduction, the authors mention the potential for informing improvements in higher-dimensional domains. Could the authors elaborate on specific insights from DualDiff that could be applied to higher-dimensional diffusion models? What specific aspects of the dual-expert architecture or the diversity loss term could be beneficial in more complex, high-dimensional scenarios? These questions are crucial for understanding the limitations and potential of the proposed method and for guiding future research in this area.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n4.25\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",
                "summary": "This paper introduces DualDiff, a novel dual-expert denoising architecture designed to enhance the performance of diffusion models, particularly in low-dimensional data settings where capturing multi-modal distributions is challenging. The core idea revolves around employing two specialized expert networks, each potentially focusing on different modes of the data distribution, and dynamically combining their outputs using a gating mechanism. This gating mechanism, implemented as a separate multi-layer perceptron (MLP), takes the same input as the expert networks and outputs a scalar value between 0 and 1, effectively determining the weight assigned to each expert's prediction. The authors also introduce a diversity loss term to further encourage the model to capture multiple modes in the data distribution. The method is evaluated on a range of datasets, including 2D synthetic datasets (circle, dino, line, moons), MNIST, and CIFAR-10. The empirical results demonstrate that DualDiff achieves significant improvements in mode capture and sample diversity compared to traditional single-network denoisers, as evidenced by a notable reduction in KL divergence. Specifically, the paper reports a 38.7% reduction in KL divergence on the complex 'dino' dataset. The authors also present ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of their architecture, such as enhanced gating and increased capacity of the expert networks. The paper concludes by acknowledging the limitations of the current approach, particularly the diminishing returns in high-dimensional spaces and the increased computational costs, and suggests future research directions, including investigating the scalability of the dual-expert architecture to higher-dimensional spaces and exploring adaptive expert counts based on data complexity. Overall, the paper presents a compelling approach to addressing the limitations of single-expert diffusion models in low-dimensional settings, with clear empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed dual-expert architecture and diversity loss. The work highlights the potential of specialized architectures for improving diffusion models in challenging data scenarios, opening new avenues for applications in scientific simulation and data analysis.",

                "weaknesses": "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. Firstly, the experiments are primarily conducted on 2D datasets, which raises significant questions about the scalability of the approach to higher-dimensional spaces. While the paper includes results on MNIST and CIFAR-10, the analysis and discussion primarily focus on the 2D datasets. The authors themselves acknowledge the 'diminishing returns in high-dimensional spaces' in the 'CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK' section, and the 'SCALABILITY ANALYSIS' section only briefly mentions that the relative improvement decreases for higher dimensions. This lack of thorough exploration of higher-dimensional data is a major limitation, as it is unclear whether the proposed dual-expert architecture and gating mechanism would be as effective in more complex, high-dimensional scenarios. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on how the gating mechanism would behave with increased dimensionality. Would the gating network still be able to effectively combine the outputs of the two experts, or would it become overwhelmed by the increased input space? Furthermore, the computational cost of the gating mechanism and the two expert networks should be analyzed in the context of higher dimensions. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with each component of the architecture, such as the expert networks and the gating mechanism. While the 'COMPUTATIONAL COSTS' section states that the dual-expert architecture adds 38% more parameters, 25-40% longer training time, and 15-30% higher memory usage compared to a single-expert model, it does not provide a breakdown of these costs per component. This lack of granularity makes it difficult to assess the trade-offs between performance gains and increased computational requirements. The paper also lacks a thorough exploration of the impact of different architectural choices for the expert networks and the gating mechanism. While the 'METHOD' section describes the expert networks as 'multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with residual connections' and the gating network as a 'separate MLP', it lacks specific details about the number of layers, width, or activation functions used in these MLPs.

The authors suggest that grokking is related to the Minimal Description Length (MDL) principle, which posits that the best model is the one that minimizes the sum of the training loss and the description length of the model. To quantify MDL, the authors introduce a new method based on weight pruning, where they approximate MDL by counting the number of non-zero weights above a certain threshold. They then conduct experiments on various tasks, including modular arithmetic and permutation tasks, and analyze the relationship between MDL and generalization. The authors claim that their findings provide insights into the mechanisms behind grokking and offer a new tool for predicting and potentially inducing generalization in machine learning models.\n\n### Soundness\n\n1\n\n### Presentation\n\n1\n\n### Contribution\n\n1\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper's strengths lie in its novel approach to understanding grokking through the lens of the Minimal Description Length (MDL) principle. The authors' use of weight pruning as a means to quantify MDL is innovative and provides a new perspective on the phenomenon. The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the methodology and experiments. The inclusion of visualizations, such as the graph in Figure 3, aids in understanding the relationship between MDL and generalization. The authors' exploration of grokking in the context of transformer-based models is also a valuable contribution, as it extends the study of this phenomenon beyond its initial observations in simpler models. The paper's findings have potential implications for the field of machine learning, particularly in understanding and improving the generalization capabilities of models.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\nThe paper has several significant weaknesses that undermine its contributions. First, the claim that the paper introduces a novel MDL estimation technique is misleading. While the authors propose using weight pruning as a means to estimate MDL, this is not a novel approach, as similar methods have been explored in prior work, such as the paper \"Deep Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Pruning, Trained Quantization and Huffman Coding\" by Han et al. The authors fail to adequately acknowledge this prior work, which diminishes the novelty of their contribution. Furthermore, the paper's claim that grokking is caused by MDL is not supported by the evidence presented. The experiments show a correlation between MDL reduction and generalization, but correlation does not imply causation. The authors do not provide sufficient evidence to establish a causal link between MDL and grokking. The paper also lacks a rigorous theoretical framework for the proposed MDL estimation technique. The authors do not provide a formal justification for using weight pruning as a proxy for MDL, nor do they explore the limitations of this approximation. The paper's experimental setup is also limited, with a focus on relatively simple tasks such as modular arithmetic and permutation tasks. While these tasks are useful for studying grokking, the authors do not demonstrate the generalizability of their findings to more complex, real-world problems. The paper also suffers from a lack of engagement with the existing literature on grokking. The authors fail to address the criticisms raised in other papers, such as the one mentioned in the review, \"Grokking, but not as we know it,\" which challenges some of the common interpretations of grokking. This lack of engagement with the broader literature weakens the paper's overall contribution. Finally, the paper's writing quality is poor, with numerous grammatical errors and unclear phrasing. This makes the paper difficult to read and understand, further detracting from its overall quality.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe authors should significantly revise their claims regarding the novelty of their MDL estimation technique. While the specific implementation using weight pruning might have minor differences, the core idea of using weight sparsity as a proxy for model complexity is not new. To strengthen their contribution, the authors should clearly articulate how their method differs from existing approaches and provide a more thorough comparison with prior work. This should include a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their method compared to other MDL estimation techniques. Furthermore, the authors need to provide a more rigorous theoretical justification for their MDL estimation method. They should explain why weight pruning is a valid approximation of MDL and discuss the limitations of this approach. This should include a formal analysis of the relationship between weight sparsity and description length, as well as an exploration of the potential biases introduced by the pruning process. The authors should also consider exploring alternative MDL estimation techniques to validate their findings and demonstrate the robustness of their conclusions.\n\nTo address the causality issue, the authors need to conduct more targeted experiments that can establish a causal link between MDL and grokking. This could involve manipulating the MDL of the model directly and observing the effect on generalization. For example, the authors could try explicitly enforcing sparsity during training and see if this induces grokking behavior. They should also explore other factors that might contribute to grokking, such as the learning rate, batch size, and network architecture. A more thorough analysis of these factors would help to clarify the role of MDL in the grokking phenomenon. The authors should also expand their experimental setup to include more complex, real-world tasks. This would help to demonstrate the generalizability of their findings and increase the impact of their work. The current focus on simple tasks limits the practical relevance of their conclusions. The authors should also engage more thoroughly with the existing literature on grokking. They should address the criticisms raised in other papers and discuss how their findings relate to previous work. This would help to contextualize their contribution and strengthen the overall argument of the paper.\n\nFinally, the authors must significantly improve the writing quality of the paper. The numerous grammatical errors and unclear phrasing make the paper difficult to read and understand. The authors should carefully proofread their manuscript and ensure that it is free of errors. They should also seek feedback from others to improve the clarity and conciseness of their writing. The paper needs to be more accessible to a wider audience, and this can only be achieved through clear and precise writing. The authors should also ensure that all figures and tables are properly referenced in the text and that all citations are accurate and complete. The missing figure references and incorrect citations detract from the overall quality of the paper and should be addressed in the revision.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. How does your MDL estimation technique differ from existing methods that use weight pruning for model compression? What are the specific advantages of your approach?\n2. Can you provide more evidence to support the claim that grokking is caused by MDL? What experiments have you conducted to establish this causal relationship?\n3. How does your work relate to other interpretations of grokking, such as those discussed in \"Grokking, but not as we know it\"? How do you address the criticisms raised in that paper?\n4. What theoretical justification can you provide for using weight pruning as a proxy for MDL? How does this approximation affect the validity of your results?\n5. Have you conducted experiments on more complex, real-world tasks to validate the generalizability of your findings? If not, what are your plans for future work in this direction?\n\n### Rating\n\n1\n\n### Confidence\n\n5\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to understanding grokking in neural networks by examining the relationship between grokking and Minimal Description Length (MDL). The authors hypothesize that the compression of internal representations, quantified by MDL, is a key factor in the grokking process. To test this, they introduce a novel MDL estimation technique based on weight pruning and apply it to diverse datasets, including modular arithmetic and permutation tasks. The experiments reveal a strong correlation between MDL reduction and improved generalization, with MDL transition points often preceding or coinciding with grokking events.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n1\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The paper introduces a novel MDL estimation technique for neural networks based on weight pruning, which is a significant contribution to the field. \n- The paper provides empirical evidence for the relationship between MDL reduction and improved generalization in the context of grokking. \n- The authors identify distinct MDL evolution patterns in grokking versus non-grokking scenarios, which could help in predicting when grokking might occur.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n - The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed MDL estimation technique, particularly in the context of different network architectures and datasets. The authors should address how the choice of pruning method and threshold might affect the MDL estimates and whether the technique is applicable to other types of neural networks beyond transformers. For example, the sensitivity of MDL to different pruning strategies (e.g., magnitude-based vs. gradient-based) and the impact of varying pruning rates on the observed correlation with grokking should be explored. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the potential for the pruning process itself to alter the network's learning dynamics, potentially confounding the interpretation of MDL as a measure of representation compression.\n- The paper does not adequately address the computational overhead associated with tracking MDL during training, especially for large-scale models. The authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of their pruning-based MDL estimation technique, including the time and memory requirements for different network sizes and pruning thresholds. It is unclear whether the proposed method is scalable to very large models, and the authors should discuss potential optimizations or alternative MDL estimation methods that could be more computationally efficient.\n- The paper's experimental setup is limited to relatively small-scale problems and datasets. The authors should extend their experiments to more complex and realistic tasks to demonstrate the generalizability of their findings. The current experiments on modular arithmetic and permutation tasks, while useful for initial exploration, do not fully capture the complexities of real-world applications. The authors should consider evaluating their approach on larger datasets and more complex architectures, such as those used in computer vision or natural language processing, to assess the robustness of the MDL-grokking relationship.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe authors should conduct a more thorough investigation into the sensitivity of their MDL estimation technique to various pruning parameters. Specifically, they should explore how different pruning strategies (e.g., magnitude-based, gradient-based, or random pruning) and varying pruning thresholds affect the resulting MDL values and their correlation with grokking. It would be beneficial to include a detailed analysis of the trade-off between pruning rate and the accuracy of MDL estimation, as well as the potential for pruning to introduce biases or artifacts in the learning process. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the impact of different network architectures on the MDL-grokking relationship. This could involve comparing the MDL evolution in transformers with that in other types of neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks. Such an analysis would help to establish the generality of their findings and identify potential limitations of their approach.\n\nTo address the computational overhead of tracking MDL, the authors should explore more efficient MDL estimation techniques. This could involve investigating alternative methods for approximating MDL that do not rely on computationally expensive pruning procedures. For example, they could consider using methods based on information theory or other measures of model complexity. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of their pruning-based MDL estimation technique, including the time and memory requirements for different network sizes and pruning thresholds. This analysis should include a discussion of potential optimizations or alternative MDL estimation methods that could be more computationally efficient, such as using a subset of the weights for MDL estimation or employing more efficient pruning algorithms. The authors should also consider the scalability of their approach to very large models and discuss any potential limitations in this regard.\n\nFinally, the authors should extend their experimental evaluation to more complex and realistic tasks. This could involve evaluating their approach on larger datasets and more complex architectures, such as those used in computer vision or natural language processing. For example, they could investigate the MDL-grokking relationship in image classification tasks using datasets like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, or in natural language processing tasks using datasets like GLUE or SQuAD. Such experiments would help to assess the robustness of their findings and demonstrate the generalizability of their approach to real-world applications. Furthermore, the authors should consider exploring the relationship between MDL and other measures of model complexity, such as the number of parameters or the FLOPs required for inference. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to grokking and the role of MDL in this process.\n\n### Questions\n\n- How sensitive is the MDL estimation to the choice of the pruning threshold, and how did you determine the optimal threshold for your experiments?\n- Can you provide more insights into the relationship between MDL and other measures of model complexity, such as the number of parameters or the FLOPs required for inference?\n- How does the MDL evolution differ across various network architectures, and can you provide comparative results for different types of neural networks?\n- What are the computational costs associated with tracking MDL during training, and how does this scale with the size of the model and dataset?\n- Can you provide more details on the experimental setup, including the specific hyperparameters used for training and the rationale behind their selection?\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 3\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper investigates the relationship between Minimal Description Length (MDL) and grokking in neural networks, proposing that MDL can explain the sudden generalization phenomenon known as grokking.

The paper does not adequately address the computational overhead associated with tracking MDL during training. This could be a significant limitation for large-scale models, and the authors should discuss potential optimizations or alternative MDL estimation techniques that are more computationally efficient.\n2. The choice of the pruning threshold (epsilon) for MDL estimation seems somewhat arbitrary. While the authors provide some justification, a more systematic exploration of different thresholds and their impact on the results would strengthen the paper.\n3. The paper primarily focuses on transformer-based models. It would be beneficial to explore the relationship between MDL and grokking in other architectures, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks, to assess the generality of the findings.\n4. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing theories of generalization, such as the Information Bottleneck theory or the role of double descent in grokking. A clearer articulation of how MDL relates to and differs from these theories would enhance the theoretical grounding of the work.\n5. The paper does not explore the potential for using MDL as a training objective to induce grokking. This could be a promising direction for future work and would provide stronger evidence for the causal role of MDL in generalization.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper introduces an interesting perspective on grokking through the lens of Minimal Description Length (MDL), but several aspects could be strengthened to enhance its impact. First, the computational cost of tracking MDL, particularly with weight pruning, needs more thorough consideration. While the authors propose a novel MDL estimation technique, they should also investigate alternative, more computationally efficient methods, such as using a moving average of the weight magnitudes or employing more sophisticated pruning algorithms that minimize overhead. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the time complexity of the proposed method, compared to standard training, would be beneficial. This would allow readers to better understand the practical limitations of the approach, especially when applied to large-scale models. The authors should also explore the trade-off between the accuracy of MDL estimation and the computational cost, providing guidelines for selecting appropriate methods based on the available resources.\n\nSecond, the choice of the pruning threshold (epsilon) requires more rigorous justification. The current approach seems somewhat arbitrary, and the authors should conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine how different thresholds affect the MDL estimates and the observed correlation with grokking. This analysis should include a range of epsilon values and should explore the impact on both the timing and magnitude of MDL transitions. It would also be helpful to visualize the MDL curves for different epsilon values, allowing readers to better understand the robustness of the findings. Additionally, the authors should consider adaptive thresholding techniques that adjust the pruning threshold based on the training dynamics, potentially leading to more stable and reliable MDL estimates. This would also address the concern that a fixed threshold might not be optimal for all training scenarios.\n\nFinally, the paper should broaden its scope by exploring the relationship between MDL and grokking in other neural network architectures. While the focus on transformer-based models is understandable given their relevance, the authors should also investigate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to assess the generality of their findings. This would involve adapting the MDL estimation technique to these architectures and conducting experiments on tasks that are well-suited for CNNs and RNNs. Furthermore, the authors should explore the potential for using MDL as a training objective to induce grokking. This could involve incorporating an MDL penalty term into the loss function or using MDL as a criterion for model selection. Such an approach would provide stronger evidence for the causal role of MDL in generalization and could lead to the development of new training strategies that promote sudden generalization.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Could the authors provide more details on the computational cost of tracking MDL during training? How does this overhead scale with the size of the model and dataset?\n2. How sensitive are the results to the choice of the pruning threshold (epsilon)? Could the authors provide a more systematic analysis of different thresholds and their impact on the findings?\n3. Have the authors considered exploring the relationship between MDL and grokking in other neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks? This would help assess the generality of the findings.\n4. How does the proposed MDL framework relate to other theories of generalization, such as the Information Bottleneck theory or the role of double descent in grokking? A clearer comparison would enhance the theoretical grounding of the work.\n5. Is it possible to use MDL as a training objective to induce grokking? This could be a promising direction for future work and would provide stronger evidence for the causal role of MDL in generalization.\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 4\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper explores the relationship between grokking and MDL. The authors propose that grokking is a result of the model minimizing its description length. They test this hypothesis by tracking the MDL of a model during training and comparing it to the model's generalization performance. The results show that the MDL of the model decreases significantly during grokking, supporting the authors' hypothesis.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3\n\n### Presentation\n\n3\n\n### Contribution\n\n3\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper provides a novel perspective on grokking, linking it to the concept of MDL. This connection is interesting and could lead to a better understanding of the phenomenon.\n\n2. The authors provide empirical evidence to support their hypothesis, using a variety of tasks and datasets. The results are convincing and show a clear correlation between MDL and grokking.\n\n3. The paper is well-written and easy to understand. The authors clearly explain their hypothesis, methodology, and results.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper does not provide a theoretical explanation for why grokking is related to MDL. While the empirical results are interesting, a theoretical framework would strengthen the paper's claims.\n\n2. The authors only consider a single model architecture (transformer) in their experiments. It would be interesting to see if the results generalize to other architectures.\n\n3. The paper does not explore the relationship between MDL and grokking in detail. For example, it is not clear whether MDL is a necessary or sufficient condition for grokking.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit significantly from a more detailed theoretical grounding of the observed relationship between grokking and MDL. While the empirical results are compelling, the lack of a theoretical framework leaves open questions about the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the authors should explore potential connections to existing theories of generalization, such as the information bottleneck principle or the minimum description length principle itself. A more rigorous analysis could involve deriving bounds or approximations for the MDL of neural networks, perhaps using techniques from information theory or statistical mechanics. This would provide a deeper understanding of why minimizing MDL might lead to grokking and under what conditions this relationship holds. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to investigate the specific properties of the learned representations that contribute to the observed MDL reduction during grokking. For example, are certain types of features or weight distributions more conducive to MDL minimization, and how do these relate to the generalization performance?\n\nTo strengthen the empirical findings, the authors should expand their experiments to include a wider range of model architectures beyond transformers. While transformers are a popular choice, it is crucial to determine whether the observed MDL-grokking relationship is a general phenomenon or specific to this architecture. Exploring other architectures, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks, would provide a more comprehensive view of the phenomenon. This would also help to identify potential architectural biases that might influence the MDL-grokking relationship. Furthermore, the authors should consider varying the hyperparameters of the models, such as the learning rate, batch size, and regularization strength, to see how these factors affect the MDL and grokking behavior. This would provide a more robust understanding of the relationship and its sensitivity to different training conditions. It would also be beneficial to explore different optimization algorithms, as these can also impact the learning dynamics and the resulting model representations.\n\nFinally, the paper should delve deeper into the nature of the relationship between MDL and grokking. The current analysis primarily focuses on correlational evidence, but it does not establish whether MDL is a necessary or sufficient condition for grokking. To address this, the authors could design experiments that directly manipulate the MDL of the model during training. For example, they could introduce regularization terms that explicitly penalize or encourage MDL, and then observe how this affects the grokking behavior. This would provide a more causal understanding of the relationship. Additionally, it would be useful to investigate the temporal dynamics of MDL and grokking. Do they always occur together, or can there be cases where MDL decreases without grokking, or vice versa? A more detailed analysis of these temporal relationships would provide a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Can the authors provide a theoretical explanation for why grokking is related to MDL?\n\n2. Have the authors considered exploring the relationship between MDL and grokking in other model architectures?\n\n3. What are the limitations of the proposed MDL estimation technique?\n\n### Rating\n\n6\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********\n\n}\n\nI have finished generating simulated reviews from 4 reviewers.

Weakness Statement:\n\"The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed MDL estimation technique, particularly in the context of different network architectures and datasets.

For example, the sensitivity of MDL to different pruning strategies (e.g., magnitude-based vs. gradient-based) and the impact of varying pruning rates on the observed correlation with grokking should be explored. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the potential for the pruning process itself to alter the network's learning dynamics, potentially confounding the interpretation of MDL as a measure of representation compression.\"\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\na) Method-related Evidence:\n   - The \"MDL Estimation Technique\" section describes the method as \"pruning weights below a threshold ϵ and counting the remaining non-zero weights.\" It mentions that \"The threshold ϵ is set to 10^−2, which was found to provide a robust balance between sensitivity and stability across different tasks and architectures.\" However, the justification for this specific threshold and the exploration of other pruning strategies are limited.\n   - The paper doesn't explicitly discuss the potential for pruning to alter learning dynamics.\n\nb) Experiment-related Evidence:\n   - The \"Extended Evaluation on Image and Text Tasks\" section shows the method applied to ResNet-18 and a Transformer model for sentiment analysis, suggesting some applicability beyond the initial transformer setup.

The authors introduce a novel MDL estimation technique based on weight pruning, where they approximate MDL by counting the number of non-zero weights above a certain threshold. They apply this technique to various tasks, including modular arithmetic and permutation tasks, and find a strong correlation between MDL reduction and improved generalization, with MDL transition points often preceding or coinciding with grokking events. The paper's core contributions include a practical MDL estimation method, empirical evidence linking MDL reduction to grokking, and the identification of distinct MDL evolution patterns in grokking versus non-grokking scenarios. However, the paper's claims are somewhat undermined by the lack of a rigorous theoretical framework, limited exploration of different network architectures, and insufficient discussion of the computational overhead and limitations of the proposed MDL estimation technique. Despite these limitations, the paper offers valuable insights into the mechanisms behind grokking and suggests a new tool for predicting and potentially inducing generalization in machine learning models.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n1.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe paper's strengths lie in its novel approach to understanding grokking through the lens of the Minimal Description Length (MDL) principle.

This approach is particularly valuable because it offers a new perspective on the grokking phenomenon, which has been observed in various models but not thoroughly explained. The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the methodology and experiments, making it accessible to a broad audience. The inclusion of visualizations, such as the graph in Figure 3, effectively aids in understanding the relationship between MDL and generalization.

First, the claim that the paper introduces a novel MDL estimation technique is misleading. While the authors propose using weight pruning as a means to estimate MDL, this is not a novel approach, as similar methods have been explored in prior work, such as the paper \"Deep Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Pruning, Trained Quantization and Huffman Coding\" by Han et al. The authors fail to adequately acknowledge this prior work, which diminishes the novelty of their contribution.

The experiments show a correlation between MDL reduction and generalization, but correlation does not imply causation. The authors do not provide sufficient evidence to establish a causal link between MDL and grokking. The paper also lacks a rigorous theoretical framework for the proposed MDL estimation technique.

First, the computational cost of tracking MDL, particularly with weight pruning, needs more thorough consideration. While the authors propose a novel MDL estimation technique, they should also investigate alternative, more computationally efficient methods, such as using a moving average of the weight magnitudes or employing more sophisticated pruning algorithms that minimize overhead. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the time complexity of the proposed method, compared to standard training, would be beneficial. This would allow readers to better understand the practical limitations of the approach, especially when applied to large-scale models. The authors should also explore the trade-off between the accuracy of MDL estimation and the computational cost, providing guidelines for selecting appropriate methods based on the available resources.\n\nSecond, the choice of the pruning threshold (epsilon) requires more rigorous justification. The current approach seems somewhat arbitrary, and the authors should conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine how different thresholds affect the MDL estimates and the observed correlation with grokking. This analysis should include a range of epsilon values and should explore the impact on both the timing and magnitude of MDL transitions. It would also be helpful to visualize the MDL curves for different epsilon values, allowing readers to better understand the robustness of the findings. Additionally, the authors should consider adaptive thresholding techniques that adjust the pruning threshold based on the training dynamics, potentially leading to more stable and reliable MDL estimates. This would also address the concern that a fixed threshold might not be optimal for all training scenarios.\n\nFinally, the paper should broaden its scope by exploring the relationship between MDL and grokking in other neural network architectures. While the focus on transformer-based models is understandable given their relevance, the authors should also investigate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to assess the generality of their findings. This would involve adapting the MDL estimation technique to these architectures and conducting experiments on tasks that are well-suited for CNNs and RNNs. Furthermore, the authors should explore the potential for using MDL as a training objective to induce grokking. This could involve incorporating an MDL penalty term into the loss function or using MDL as a criterion for model selection. Such an approach would provide stronger evidence for the causal role of MDL in generalization and could lead to the development of new training strategies that promote sudden generalization.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

The paper does not provide a theoretical explanation for why grokking is related to MDL.

The authors only consider a single model architecture (transformer) in their experiments. It would be interesting to see if the results generalize to other architectures.\n\n3. The paper does not explore the relationship between MDL and grokking in detail. For example, it is not clear whether MDL is a necessary or sufficient condition for grokking.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit significantly from a more detailed theoretical grounding of the observed relationship between grokking and MDL. While the empirical results are compelling, the lack of a theoretical framework leaves open questions about the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the authors should explore potential connections to existing theories of generalization, such as the information bottleneck principle or the minimum description length principle itself. A more rigorous analysis could involve deriving bounds or approximations for the MDL of neural networks, perhaps using techniques from information theory or statistical mechanics. This would provide a deeper understanding of why minimizing MDL might lead to grokking and under what conditions this relationship holds. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to investigate the specific properties of the learned representations that contribute to the observed MDL reduction during grokking. For example, are certain types of features or weight distributions more conducive to MDL minimization, and how do these relate to the generalization performance?\n\nTo strengthen the empirical findings, the authors should expand their experiments to include a wider range of model architectures beyond transformers. While transformers are a popular choice, it is crucial to determine whether the observed MDL-grokking relationship is a general phenomenon or specific to this architecture. Exploring other architectures, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks, would provide a more comprehensive view of the phenomenon. This would also help to identify potential architectural biases that might influence the MDL-grokking relationship. Furthermore, the authors should consider varying the hyperparameters of the models, such as the learning rate, batch size, and regularization strength, to see how these factors affect the MDL and grokking behavior. This would provide a more robust understanding of the relationship and its sensitivity to different training conditions. It would also be beneficial to explore different optimization algorithms, as these can also impact the learning dynamics and the resulting model representations.\n\nFinally, the paper should delve deeper into the nature of the relationship between MDL and grokking. The current analysis primarily focuses on correlational evidence, but it does not establish whether MDL is a necessary or sufficient condition for grokking. To address this, the authors could design experiments that directly manipulate the MDL of the model during training. For example, they could introduce regularization terms that explicitly penalize or encourage MDL, and then observe how this affects the grokking behavior. This would provide a more causal understanding of the relationship. Additionally, it would be useful to investigate the temporal dynamics of MDL and grokking. Do they always occur together, or can there be cases where MDL decreases without grokking, or vice versa? A more detailed analysis of these temporal relationships would provide a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

The authors introduce a novel MDL estimation technique based on weight pruning, where they approximate MDL by counting the number of non-zero weights above a certain threshold. They apply this technique to various tasks, including modular arithmetic and permutation tasks, and find a strong correlation between MDL reduction and improved generalization, with MDL transition points often preceding or coinciding with grokking events. The paper's core contributions include a practical MDL estimation method, empirical evidence linking MDL reduction to grokking, and the identification of distinct MDL evolution patterns in grokking versus non-grokking scenarios. However, the paper's claims are somewhat undermined by the lack of a rigorous theoretical framework, limited exploration of different network architectures, and insufficient discussion of the computational overhead and limitations of the proposed MDL estimation technique.

The authors should also consider exploring alternative MDL estimation techniques to validate their findings and demonstrate the robustness of their conclusions. To address the causality issue, the authors need to conduct more targeted experiments that can establish a causal link between MDL and grokking. This could involve manipulating the MDL of the model directly and observing the effect on generalization. For example, the authors could try explicitly enforcing sparsity during training and see if this induces grokking behavior. They should also explore other factors that might contribute to grokking, such as the learning rate, batch size, and network architecture. A more thorough analysis of these factors would help to clarify the role of MDL in the grokking phenomenon. The authors should also expand their experimental setup to include more complex, real-world tasks. This would help to demonstrate the generalizability of their findings and increase the impact of their work. The current focus on simple tasks limits the practical relevance of their conclusions. The authors should consider evaluating their approach on larger datasets and more complex architectures, such as those used in computer vision or natural language processing, to assess the robustness of the MDL-grokking relationship.

The authors compared five initialization methods, namely PyTorch default, Xavier, He, Orthogonal, and Kaiming Normal, to understand their influence on grokking behavior. The results show that different initialization methods significantly affect the convergence speed and generalization capabilities of Transformer models. Notably, Xavier initialization consistently outperformed other methods, achieving faster convergence and higher validation accuracy across multiple tasks.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n2\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. This paper is easy to follow.\n2. The research topic is interesting.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The experimental setup is small, and the tasks are relatively simple, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to larger models and more complex real-world problems.\n2. The study focuses on a specific set of arithmetic tasks in finite fields, which may not fully represent the complexity of real-world problems where Transformers are typically applied.\n3. While the paper demonstrates that certain initialization methods can accelerate grokking, it does not provide a theoretical explanation for why this occurs.\n4. The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the interplay between initialization methods and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules, which could also influence grokking behavior.\n5. The paper does not explore adaptive initialization methods that evolve during training, which could potentially lead to more robust and efficient learning algorithms.\n6. The paper does not extend the study to other types of neural architectures beyond Transformers, limiting the generalizability of the findings across different model types.\n8. The paper does not provide concrete guidelines or tools for practitioners to apply the findings in real-world applications, which could limit the practical impact of the research.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper's exploration of weight initialization strategies and their impact on grokking in Transformers is a valuable contribution, but several key areas could be strengthened to enhance its impact and generalizability. First, the study should expand its experimental scope beyond the current small-scale setup and simple arithmetic tasks. While finite field arithmetic provides a controlled environment, it is crucial to investigate whether the observed trends hold for more complex tasks, such as natural language processing or computer vision. This could involve using larger datasets, more intricate model architectures, and tasks that better reflect real-world applications of Transformers. Furthermore, the paper should explore the impact of different dataset sizes and complexities on the relationship between initialization and grokking. This would help to determine the robustness of the findings and their applicability to a wider range of scenarios. \n\nSecond, the paper needs to delve deeper into the theoretical underpinnings of the observed phenomena. While the empirical results demonstrate that certain initialization methods accelerate grokking, a theoretical explanation is needed to understand why this occurs. This could involve analyzing the optimization landscape and how different initialization methods affect the convergence properties of the model. For example, the authors could investigate how different initializations affect the spectral properties of the weight matrices, which could in turn influence the learning dynamics. Additionally, the paper should explore the interplay between initialization methods and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules, batch size, and regularization techniques. A more comprehensive analysis of these interactions would provide a more complete understanding of the factors that influence grokking behavior. Specifically, the authors could perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how the optimal initialization method varies with different hyperparameter settings. This would provide valuable insights for practitioners seeking to apply these findings in real-world scenarios.\n\nFinally, the paper should consider exploring adaptive initialization methods that evolve during training. These methods could potentially lead to more robust and efficient learning algorithms by dynamically adjusting the initial weights based on the learning progress. For example, the authors could investigate methods that incorporate feedback from the training process to refine the initial weights, potentially leading to faster convergence and better generalization. Furthermore, the paper should extend its study to other types of neural architectures beyond Transformers. This would help to determine whether the observed trends are specific to Transformers or whether they generalize to other model types. By addressing these points, the paper could significantly enhance its impact and provide more practical guidance for practitioners seeking to leverage weight initialization strategies to improve the performance of their models.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease refer to the weakness.\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper investigates the impact of weight initialization strategies on grokking in Transformer models, specifically in the context of arithmetic tasks.

The figures in the paper are not in the PDF format.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe study's focus on a small Transformer model and simple arithmetic tasks raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. Future work should explore the impact of weight initialization on grokking using larger models and more complex tasks that are representative of real-world applications. For example, experiments could be conducted on natural language processing tasks or image recognition problems, which are more typical use cases for Transformer models. Furthermore, the arithmetic tasks are all based on modular arithmetic, which may not fully capture the nuances of other types of computations. It would be beneficial to include tasks that involve continuous operations or more complex mathematical functions to assess the robustness of the observed effects. The current setup, while controlled, may not fully reflect the challenges encountered in practical scenarios, thus limiting the broader applicability of the conclusions.\n\nWhile the paper identifies that certain initialization methods accelerate grokking, it lacks a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Future research should delve into the underlying mechanisms that cause these differences in convergence speed. This could involve analyzing the optimization landscape and how different initializations affect the trajectory of the model's parameters during training. For instance, one could investigate whether certain initializations lead to a smoother loss landscape or a more direct path to the optimal solution. Additionally, the study should explore the relationship between the initialization method and the emergence of specific features or representations within the Transformer model. Understanding these aspects could provide valuable insights into the nature of grokking and how it can be effectively induced. Furthermore, the paper should explore the interplay between initialization methods and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules, batch size, and regularization techniques. A more comprehensive analysis of these interactions would provide a more complete understanding of the factors that influence grokking behavior.\n\nFinally, the paper should consider exploring adaptive initialization methods that evolve during training, which could potentially lead to more robust and efficient learning algorithms.

This paper focuses on the impact of weight initialization on grokking, which is a novel perspective in understanding the grokking phenomenon.\n\n2. The experimental design is rigorous, with multiple runs and statistical validation to ensure the robustness of the results.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The scope of the experiments is limited to small Transformer architectures and arithmetic tasks, which may not fully generalize to larger models or more complex real-world problems. Specifically, the use of a 2-layer Transformer with 128 dimensions and 4 attention heads, while sufficient for observing grokking, does not explore the behavior of deeper or wider models, which might exhibit different sensitivities to initialization strategies. The arithmetic tasks, while well-defined, are also a simplification of real-world problems, and it's unclear if the observed effects would translate to more complex tasks such as natural language processing or computer vision.\n\n2. The paper lacks a theoretical explanation for why certain initialization methods are more effective for grokking. While the empirical results are clear, the underlying mechanisms that cause Xavier initialization to outperform others remain unexplored. For example, it is not clear if the improved performance is due to better gradient flow, a more favorable loss landscape, or some other factor. A deeper analysis of the optimization dynamics is needed to understand the observed phenomena.\n\n3. The paper does not explore the interaction between initialization methods and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules or model architectures. The experiments are conducted with a fixed learning rate schedule and model architecture, which limits the understanding of how initialization interacts with these other factors. For instance, it is possible that the optimal initialization method depends on the learning rate or the depth of the network. A more comprehensive study would explore these interactions.\n\n4. The paper does not provide concrete guidelines or tools for practitioners to apply the findings in real-world applications. While the results suggest that Xavier initialization is generally better for grokking, it is not clear how practitioners should choose initialization methods for their specific tasks. The paper lacks practical recommendations or a decision-making framework that could guide practitioners in selecting the appropriate initialization strategy.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo strengthen the paper, the authors should consider expanding the scope of their experiments to include larger Transformer models and more complex tasks. This would involve exploring the impact of initialization strategies on models with more layers, larger hidden dimensions, and different attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the behavior of these initialization methods on tasks beyond arithmetic, such as sequence-to-sequence tasks or tasks involving natural language understanding. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the generalizability of their findings. It would also be beneficial to explore the impact of different dataset sizes and complexities on the observed grokking phenomenon, as this could reveal how initialization interacts with the learning process under different data regimes. Such an analysis would significantly enhance the practical relevance of the study.\n\nIn addition to expanding the experimental scope, the authors should also delve deeper into the theoretical underpinnings of their findings. This could involve analyzing the gradient dynamics during training, examining the loss landscape, and investigating the feature representations learned by different initialization methods. For example, the authors could analyze the singular values of the weight matrices to understand how different initializations affect the propagation of gradients. They could also visualize the loss landscape to see if certain initializations lead to smoother or more favorable optimization paths. Furthermore, the authors could explore the information content of the learned features to see if certain initializations lead to more efficient or robust representations. Such an analysis would provide a more mechanistic understanding of why certain initialization methods are more effective for grokking.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide more concrete guidelines for practitioners on how to apply their findings in real-world applications. This could involve developing a decision-making framework that takes into account the specific characteristics of the task, the model architecture, and the available computational resources. For example, the authors could provide recommendations on how to choose the appropriate initialization method based on the type of task, the size of the dataset, and the desired level of generalization. They could also develop tools or libraries that make it easier for practitioners to experiment with different initialization strategies. Such practical guidance would significantly increase the impact of the study and make it more useful for the broader machine learning community.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

The authors compare five initialization methods: PyTorch default, Xavier (Glorot), He, Orthogonal, and Kaiming Normal. They find that different initialization methods significantly influence grokking behavior, with Xavier initialization often leading to faster convergence and better generalization.

The figures and tables effectively illustrate the results, making the findings accessible and easy to interpret.\n2. The study addresses a novel and important problem in deep learning, specifically the impact of weight initialization on grokking in Transformer models. This is a timely contribution, as grokking remains a poorly understood phenomenon, and this work provides valuable insights into how initialization can influence it.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the theoretical underpinnings of why certain initialization methods perform better for grokking. While the empirical results are compelling, a deeper theoretical exploration would strengthen the paper's contributions. Specifically, the paper does not delve into the spectral properties of the weight matrices initialized by each method, nor does it analyze how these properties might affect the optimization landscape and the emergence of grokking. For instance, do certain initializations lead to a more favorable distribution of singular values, which could facilitate faster convergence and better generalization? The absence of such analysis leaves a gap in understanding the mechanisms at play.\n2. The study is limited to a small Transformer architecture and arithmetic tasks in finite fields. It is unclear whether the findings generalize to larger models or more complex tasks, such as natural language processing. The paper does not provide any discussion on the potential limitations of the chosen architecture and task domain. For example, the arithmetic tasks in finite fields might have specific properties that are not present in other tasks, and it is not clear if the observed effects of initialization would be the same in other contexts. The lack of exploration of different model sizes and task complexities limits the scope of the conclusions.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo strengthen the theoretical underpinnings of the study, the authors should consider incorporating an analysis of the spectral properties of the weight matrices resulting from different initialization schemes. This could involve examining the distribution of singular values and eigenvalues of the weight matrices at initialization and how these properties evolve during training. For example, it would be beneficial to investigate whether certain initialization methods lead to a more balanced distribution of singular values, which could potentially facilitate better gradient flow and faster convergence. Furthermore, the authors could explore the relationship between the spectral properties of the weight matrices and the curvature of the loss landscape. This could provide insights into why certain initializations lead to better generalization performance. Such an analysis would move beyond purely empirical observations and provide a more mechanistic understanding of the observed phenomena.\n\nTo address the limitations of the study, the authors should consider expanding their experiments to include larger Transformer models and more complex tasks. This could involve evaluating the performance of different initialization methods on tasks such as natural language processing or image recognition. Furthermore, the authors could explore the impact of different model architectures, such as varying the number of layers or the dimensionality of the hidden states. This would help to determine whether the observed effects of initialization are specific to the chosen architecture or whether they generalize to other settings. The authors should also discuss the potential limitations of their chosen task domain and how these limitations might affect the generalizability of their findings. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the scope and limitations of the study.\n\nFinally, the authors should consider exploring the interaction between initialization methods and other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and batch size. It is possible that the optimal initialization method depends on the specific hyperparameter settings used during training. For example, certain initializations might be more robust to changes in the learning rate, while others might be more sensitive. By exploring these interactions, the authors could provide more practical guidance for practitioners who are looking to apply their findings in real-world settings. This would also help to further understand the mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena and how they are influenced by different training conditions.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper delves into the intriguing phenomenon of grokking in Transformer models, specifically investigating the impact of different weight initialization strategies on this behavior. The authors focus on arithmetic tasks within finite fields, a choice that allows for controlled experimentation and clear observation of the grokking phenomenon. They compare five distinct initialization methods: PyTorch's default, Xavier (Glorot), He, Orthogonal, and Kaiming Normal, across four arithmetic operations: modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation composition. The core methodology involves training small Transformer models with these various initializations and meticulously tracking the training and validation accuracy over time. The primary empirical finding is that the choice of initialization significantly influences the speed of convergence and the final generalization performance. Notably, the authors observed that Xavier initialization consistently leads to faster convergence and higher validation accuracy across the tested tasks, suggesting a particular suitability for inducing grokking in this context. The paper's contribution lies in highlighting the often-underappreciated role of weight initialization in the emergence of grokking, a phenomenon where models suddenly generalize well after a prolonged period of apparent memorization. While the paper provides a systematic empirical comparison, it does not delve deeply into the theoretical underpinnings of why certain initializations are more effective, nor does it explore the interaction of initialization with other hyperparameters. The study's focus on a small Transformer architecture and arithmetic tasks, while enabling controlled experimentation, also raises questions about the generalizability of the findings to larger models and more complex real-world scenarios. Despite these limitations, the paper offers valuable insights into the relationship between weight initialization and grokking, opening avenues for further research in this area. The authors' work underscores the importance of considering initialization strategies when training models prone to grokking, and it provides a foundation for future studies to build upon, particularly in the realm of theoretical analysis and practical applications.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThis paper presents a clear and well-structured investigation into the impact of weight initialization on the grokking phenomenon in Transformer models. I found the research topic to be both timely and relevant, as grokking remains a poorly understood aspect of deep learning, and any insight into its mechanisms is valuable. The authors' decision to focus on arithmetic tasks in finite fields is a strength, as it provides a controlled environment for observing grokking, allowing for a more systematic analysis of the effects of different initialization methods. The experimental design is rigorous, with multiple runs and statistical validation to ensure the robustness of the results. The paper's systematic comparison of five different weight initialization methods is a significant contribution, offering valuable insights into their effects on grokking behavior. The authors clearly document their methodology, making the study reproducible, which is a crucial aspect of scientific research. The empirical findings are compelling, demonstrating that different initialization methods significantly affect the convergence speed and generalization capabilities of Transformer models. The observation that Xavier initialization consistently outperforms other methods in terms of faster convergence and higher validation accuracy is a key finding that warrants further investigation. The paper's focus on a novel and important problem in deep learning, specifically the impact of weight initialization on grokking, is a significant strength. This is a timely contribution, as grokking remains a poorly understood phenomenon, and this work provides valuable insights into how initialization can influence it. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the results, making the findings accessible and easy to interpret. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its clear research question, well-designed experiments, and significant empirical findings, which contribute to a better understanding of the grokking phenomenon.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nAfter a thorough examination of the paper, I've identified several key weaknesses that significantly impact the scope and generalizability of the findings. Firstly, the experimental setup is limited by its small scale and the simplicity of the tasks. The authors employ a small Transformer architecture with only 2 layers, 128 model dimensions, and 4 attention heads (Section 3.1). This choice, while sufficient for observing grokking, does not explore the behavior of deeper or wider models, which might exhibit different sensitivities to initialization strategies. Furthermore, the study focuses on four specific arithmetic tasks within a finite field of prime order 97 (Section 3.1). While these tasks provide a controlled environment, they are a simplification of real-world problems where Transformers are typically applied. The use of modular arithmetic, in particular, may introduce specific properties that are not present in other types of computations, and it is unclear if the observed effects of initialization would be the same in other contexts. This limitation is further compounded by the fact that the paper does not provide any discussion on the potential limitations of the chosen architecture and task domain. The lack of exploration of different model sizes and task complexities limits the scope of the conclusions, making it difficult to ascertain whether the findings would generalize to larger models or more complex tasks such as natural language processing or computer vision. This is a significant concern, as the paper's conclusions are based on a very specific setup that may not be representative of the broader applications of Transformer models. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is directly supported by the explicit description of the experimental setup in Section 3.1. \n\nSecondly, the paper lacks a detailed theoretical explanation for why certain initialization methods are more effective for grokking. While the empirical results are compelling, the underlying mechanisms that cause Xavier initialization to outperform others remain unexplored. The paper includes a section titled \"5.6 Theoretical Analysis of Initialization Effects\" which provides high-level explanations related to Gradient Flow, Loss Landscape, and Feature Alignment. However, it does not include a detailed mathematical analysis or proof. Specifically, the paper does not delve into the spectral properties of the weight matrices initialized by each method, nor does it analyze how these properties might affect the optimization landscape and the emergence of grokking. For instance, it is not clear if certain initializations lead to a more favorable distribution of singular values, which could facilitate faster convergence and better generalization. The absence of such analysis leaves a gap in understanding the mechanisms at play. This lack of theoretical depth is a significant weakness, as it limits the paper's ability to provide a mechanistic understanding of the observed phenomena. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is evident from the absence of mathematical proofs or in-depth theoretical analysis beyond high-level explanations. \n\nThirdly, the paper does not explore the interaction between initialization methods and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules or model architectures. The experiments are conducted with a fixed learning rate schedule and model architecture, which limits the understanding of how initialization interacts with these other factors. For instance, it is possible that the optimal initialization method depends on the learning rate or the depth of the network. A more comprehensive study would explore these interactions. The paper states, \"We use a batch size of 512 and train for a total of 7,500 update steps, with a warmup period of 50 steps for the learning rate scheduler\" (Section 3.1) and \"Learning rate schedule: Linear warmup over 50 steps, then constant\" (Section 5.3). The paper keeps the learning rate schedule and other hyperparameters constant across different initialization methods. This lack of exploration into the interplay between initialization and other hyperparameters is a significant limitation, as it prevents a more complete understanding of the factors that influence grokking behavior. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is directly supported by the experimental setup description in Sections 3.1 and 5.3. \n\nFinally, the paper does not provide concrete guidelines or tools for practitioners to apply the findings in real-world applications. While the results suggest that Xavier initialization is generally better for grokking, it is not clear how practitioners should choose initialization methods for their specific tasks. The paper lacks practical recommendations or a decision-making framework that could guide practitioners in selecting the appropriate initialization strategy. The conclusion summarizes the findings but does not offer specific, actionable guidelines or tools for practitioners. This lack of practical guidance limits the immediate impact of the research. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is evident from the absence of practical recommendations in the conclusion section.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses and enhance the impact of this research, I recommend several concrete improvements. Firstly, the authors should significantly expand the scope of their experiments to include larger Transformer models and more complex tasks. This would involve exploring the impact of initialization strategies on models with more layers, larger hidden dimensions, and different attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the behavior of these initialization methods on tasks beyond arithmetic, such as sequence-to-sequence tasks or tasks involving natural language understanding. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the generalizability of their findings. It would also be beneficial to explore the impact of different dataset sizes and complexities on the observed grokking phenomenon, as this could reveal how initialization interacts with the learning process under different data regimes. Such an analysis would significantly enhance the practical relevance of the study. Specifically, the authors could consider using benchmark datasets from natural language processing or computer vision to assess the performance of different initialization methods in more realistic scenarios. This would help to determine whether the observed trends hold for more complex tasks and larger models. \n\nSecondly, the authors should delve deeper into the theoretical underpinnings of their findings. This could involve analyzing the gradient dynamics during training, examining the loss landscape, and investigating the feature representations learned by different initialization methods. For example, the authors could analyze the singular values of the weight matrices to understand how different initializations affect the propagation of gradients. They could also visualize the loss landscape to see if certain initializations lead to smoother or more favorable optimization paths. Furthermore, the authors could explore the information content of the learned features to see if certain initializations lead to more efficient or robust representations. Such an analysis would provide a more mechanistic understanding of why certain initialization methods are more effective for grokking. Specifically, the authors should investigate the spectral properties of the weight matrices resulting from different initialization schemes. This could involve examining the distribution of singular values and eigenvalues of the weight matrices at initialization and how these properties evolve during training. For example, it would be beneficial to investigate whether certain initializations lead to a more balanced distribution of singular values, which could potentially facilitate better gradient flow and faster convergence. Furthermore, the authors could explore the relationship between the spectral properties of the weight matrices and the curvature of the loss landscape. This could provide insights into why certain initializations lead to better generalization performance. Such an analysis would move beyond purely empirical observations and provide a more mechanistic understanding of the observed phenomena. \n\nThirdly, the authors should explore the interaction between initialization methods and other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and batch size. It is possible that the optimal initialization method depends on the specific hyperparameter settings used during training. For example, certain initializations might be more robust to changes in the learning rate, while others might be more sensitive. By exploring these interactions, the authors could provide more practical guidance for practitioners who are looking to apply their findings in real-world settings. This would also help to further understand the mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena and how they are influenced by different training conditions. Specifically, the authors could perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how the optimal initialization method varies with different hyperparameter settings. This would provide valuable insights for practitioners seeking to apply these findings in real-world scenarios. \n\nFinally, the authors should provide more concrete guidelines for practitioners on how to apply their findings in real-world applications. This could involve developing a decision-making framework that takes into account the specific characteristics of the task, the model architecture, and the available computational resources. For example, the authors could provide recommendations on how to choose the appropriate initialization method based on the type of task, the size of the dataset, and the desired level of generalization. They could also develop tools or libraries that make it easier for practitioners to experiment with different initialization strategies. Such practical guidance would significantly increase the impact of the study and make it more useful for the broader machine learning community. This could involve creating a set of best practices or a checklist that practitioners can use to select the most appropriate initialization method for their specific use case.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nAfter reviewing the paper, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for further understanding the implications of this research. Firstly, how do the observed effects of weight initialization on grokking scale with larger Transformer models and more complex tasks beyond arithmetic operations? The current study is limited to a small model and simple arithmetic tasks, and it is unclear whether the same trends would hold for larger models and more complex tasks such as natural language processing or computer vision. Understanding the scalability of these findings is crucial for assessing their practical relevance. Secondly, can the authors provide a more detailed theoretical explanation for why certain initialization methods are more effective for grokking? While the paper provides some high-level explanations, a deeper analysis of the optimization dynamics and the spectral properties of the weight matrices is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, what is the relationship between the spectral properties of the weight matrices and the curvature of the loss landscape, and how does this affect the emergence of grokking? Thirdly, how do other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules and batch size, interact with weight initialization to affect grokking? The paper keeps these hyperparameters constant across different initialization methods, but it is possible that the optimal initialization method depends on the specific hyperparameter settings used during training. A more comprehensive study of these interactions is needed to provide a more complete understanding of the factors that influence grokking behavior. Finally, how do the findings of this study compare to similar research on weight initialization and grokking in other types of neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks?

A comparison to similar research in other neural network architectures would provide a broader context for the findings and help to determine the generalizability of the results.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

First, the study should expand its experimental scope beyond the current small-scale setup and simple arithmetic tasks. While finite field arithmetic provides a controlled environment, it is crucial to investigate whether the observed trends hold for more complex tasks, such as natural language processing or computer vision. This could involve using larger datasets, more intricate model architectures, and tasks that better reflect real-world applications of Transformers. Furthermore, the paper should explore the impact of different dataset sizes and complexities on the relationship between initialization and grokking. This would help to determine the robustness of the findings and their applicability to a wider range of scenarios. \n\nSecond, the paper needs to delve deeper into the theoretical underpinnings of the observed phenomena. While the empirical results demonstrate that certain initialization methods accelerate grokking, a theoretical explanation is needed to understand why this occurs. This could involve analyzing the optimization landscape and how different initialization methods affect the convergence properties of the model. For example, the authors could investigate how different initializations affect the spectral properties of the weight matrices, which could in turn influence the learning dynamics. Additionally, the paper should explore the interplay between initialization methods and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules, batch size, and regularization techniques. A more comprehensive analysis of these interactions would provide a more complete understanding of the factors that influence grokking behavior. Specifically, the authors could perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how the optimal initialization method varies with different hyperparameter settings. This would provide valuable insights for practitioners seeking to apply these findings in real-world scenarios.\n\nFinally, the paper should consider exploring adaptive initialization methods that evolve during training. These methods could potentially lead to more robust and efficient learning algorithms by dynamically adjusting the initial weights based on the learning progress. For example, the authors could investigate methods that incorporate feedback from the training process to refine the initial weights, potentially leading to faster convergence and better generalization. Furthermore, the paper should extend its study to other types of neural architectures beyond Transformers. This would help to determine whether the observed trends are specific to Transformers or whether they generalize to other model types. By addressing these points, the paper could significantly enhance its impact and provide more practical guidance for practitioners seeking to leverage weight initialization strategies to improve the performance of their models.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease refer to the weakness.\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********"

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper delves into the intriguing phenomenon of grokking in Transformer models, specifically investigating the impact of different weight initialization strategies on this behavior. The authors focus on arithmetic tasks within finite fields, a choice that allows for controlled experimentation and clear observation of the grokking phenomenon. They compare five distinct initialization methods: PyTorch's default, Xavier (Glorot), He, Orthogonal, and Kaiming Normal, across four arithmetic operations: modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation composition. The core methodology involves training small Transformer models with these various initializations and meticulously tracking the training and validation accuracy over time. The primary empirical finding is that the choice of initialization significantly influences the speed of convergence and the final generalization performance. Notably, the authors observed that Xavier initialization consistently leads to faster convergence and higher validation accuracy across the tested tasks, suggesting a particular suitability for inducing grokking in this context. The paper's contribution lies in highlighting the often-underappreciated role of weight initialization in the emergence of grokking, a phenomenon where models suddenly generalize well after a prolonged period of apparent memorization. While the paper provides a systematic empirical comparison, it does not delve deeply into the theoretical underpinnings of why certain initializations are more effective, nor does it explore the interaction of initialization with other hyperparameters. The study's focus on a small Transformer architecture and arithmetic tasks, while enabling controlled experimentation, also raises questions about the generalizability of the findings to larger models and more complex real-world scenarios. Despite these limitations, the paper offers valuable insights into the relationship between weight initialization and grokking, opening avenues for further research in this area. The authors' work underscores the importance of considering initialization strategies when training models prone to grokking, and it provides a foundation for future studies to build upon, particularly in the realm of theoretical analysis and practical applications.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThis paper presents a clear and well-structured investigation into the impact of weight initialization on the grokking phenomenon in Transformer models. I found the research topic to be both timely and relevant, as grokking remains a poorly understood aspect of deep learning, and any insight into its mechanisms is valuable. The authors' decision to focus on arithmetic tasks in finite fields is a strength, as it provides a controlled environment for observing grokking, allowing for a more systematic analysis of the effects of different initialization methods. The experimental design is rigorous, with multiple runs and statistical validation to ensure the robustness of the results. The paper's systematic comparison of five different weight initialization methods is a significant contribution, offering valuable insights into their effects on grokking behavior. The authors clearly document their methodology, making the study reproducible, which is a crucial aspect of scientific research. The empirical findings are compelling, demonstrating that different initialization methods significantly affect the convergence speed and generalization capabilities of Transformer models. The observation that Xavier initialization consistently outperforms other methods in terms of faster convergence and higher validation accuracy is a key finding that warrants further investigation. The paper's focus on a novel and important problem in deep learning, specifically the impact of weight initialization on grokking, is a significant strength. This is a timely contribution, as grokking remains a poorly understood phenomenon, and this work provides valuable insights into how initialization can influence it. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the results, making the findings accessible and easy to interpret. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its clear research question, well-designed experiments, and significant empirical findings, which contribute to a better understanding of the grokking phenomenon.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nAfter a thorough examination of the paper, I've identified several key weaknesses that significantly impact the scope and generalizability of the findings. Firstly, the experimental setup is limited by its small scale and the simplicity of the tasks. The authors employ a small Transformer architecture with only 2 layers, 128 model dimensions, and 4 attention heads (Section 3.1). This choice, while sufficient for observing grokking, does not explore the behavior of deeper or wider models, which might exhibit different sensitivities to initialization strategies. Furthermore, the study focuses on four specific arithmetic tasks within a finite field of prime order 97 (Section 3.1). While these tasks provide a controlled environment, they are a simplification of real-world problems where Transformers are typically applied. The use of modular arithmetic, in particular, may introduce specific properties that are not present in other types of computations, and it is unclear if the observed effects of initialization would be the same in other contexts. This limitation is further compounded by the fact that the paper does not provide any discussion on the potential limitations of the chosen architecture and task domain. The lack of exploration of different model sizes and task complexities limits the scope of the conclusions, making it difficult to ascertain whether the findings would generalize to larger models or more complex tasks such as natural language processing or computer vision. This is a significant concern, as the paper's conclusions are based on a very specific setup that may not be representative of the broader applications of Transformer models. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is directly supported by the explicit description of the experimental setup in Section 3.1. \n\nSecondly, the paper lacks a detailed theoretical explanation for why certain initialization methods are more effective for grokking. While the empirical results are compelling, the underlying mechanisms that cause Xavier initialization to outperform others remain unexplored. The paper includes a section titled \"5.6 Theoretical Analysis of Initialization Effects\" which provides high-level explanations related to Gradient Flow, Loss Landscape, and Feature Alignment. However, it does not include a detailed mathematical analysis or proof. Specifically, the paper does not delve into the spectral properties of the weight matrices initialized by each method, nor does it analyze how these properties might affect the optimization landscape and the emergence of grokking. For instance, it is not clear if certain initializations lead to a more favorable distribution of singular values, which could facilitate faster convergence and better generalization. The absence of such analysis leaves a gap in understanding the mechanisms at play. This lack of theoretical depth is a significant weakness, as it limits the paper's ability to provide a mechanistic understanding of the observed phenomena. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is evident from the absence of mathematical proofs or in-depth theoretical analysis beyond high-level explanations. \n\nThirdly, the paper does not explore the interaction between initialization methods and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules or model architectures. The experiments are conducted with a fixed learning rate schedule and model architecture, which limits the understanding of how initialization interacts with these other factors. For instance, it is possible that the optimal initialization method depends on the learning rate or the depth of the network. A more comprehensive study would explore these interactions. The paper states, \"We use a batch size of 512 and train for a total of 7,500 update steps, with a warmup period of 50 steps for the learning rate scheduler\" (Section 3.1) and \"Learning rate schedule: Linear warmup over 50 steps, then constant\" (Section 5.3). The paper keeps the learning rate schedule and other hyperparameters constant across different initialization methods. This lack of exploration into the interplay between initialization and other hyperparameters is a significant limitation, as it prevents a more complete understanding of the factors that influence grokking behavior. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is directly supported by the experimental setup description in Sections 3.1 and 5.3. \n\nFinally, the paper does not provide concrete guidelines or tools for practitioners to apply the findings in real-world applications. While the results suggest that Xavier initialization is generally better for grokking, it is not clear how practitioners should choose initialization methods for their specific tasks. The paper lacks practical recommendations or a decision-making framework that could guide practitioners in selecting the appropriate initialization strategy. The conclusion summarizes the findings but does not offer specific, actionable guidelines or tools for practitioners. This lack of practical guidance limits the immediate impact of the research. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is evident from the absence of practical recommendations in the conclusion section.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses and enhance the impact of this research, I recommend several concrete improvements. Firstly, the authors should significantly expand the scope of their experiments to include larger Transformer models and more complex tasks. This would involve exploring the impact of initialization strategies on models with more layers, larger hidden dimensions, and different attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the behavior of these initialization methods on tasks beyond arithmetic, such as sequence-to-sequence tasks or tasks involving natural language understanding. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the generalizability of their findings. It would also be beneficial to explore the impact of different dataset sizes and complexities on the observed grokking phenomenon, as this could reveal how initialization interacts with the learning process under different data regimes. Such an analysis would significantly enhance the practical relevance of the study. Specifically, the authors could consider using benchmark datasets from natural language processing or computer vision to assess the performance of different initialization methods in more realistic scenarios. This would help to determine whether the observed trends hold for more complex tasks and larger models. \n\nSecondly, the authors should delve deeper into the theoretical underpinnings of their findings. This could involve analyzing the gradient dynamics during training, examining the loss landscape, and investigating the feature representations learned by different initialization methods. For example, the authors could analyze the singular values of the weight matrices to understand how different initializations affect the propagation of gradients. They could also visualize the loss landscape to see if certain initializations lead to smoother or more favorable optimization paths. Furthermore, the authors could explore the information content of the learned features to see if certain initializations lead to more efficient or robust representations. Such an analysis would provide a more mechanistic understanding of why certain initialization methods are more effective for grokking.

This could provide insights into why certain initializations lead to better generalization performance. Such an analysis would move beyond purely empirical observations and provide a more mechanistic understanding of the observed phenomena. \n\nThirdly, the authors should explore the interaction between initialization methods and other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and batch size. It is possible that the optimal initialization method depends on the specific hyperparameter settings used during training. For example, certain initializations might be more robust to changes in the learning rate, while others might be more sensitive. By exploring these interactions, the authors could provide more practical guidance for practitioners who are looking to apply their findings in real-world settings.

This could involve creating a set of best practices or a checklist that practitioners can use to select the most appropriate initialization method for their specific use case.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nAfter reviewing the paper, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for further understanding the implications of this research. Firstly, how do the observed effects of weight initialization on grokking scale with larger Transformer models and more complex tasks beyond arithmetic operations? The current study is limited to a small model and simple arithmetic tasks, and it is unclear whether the same trends would hold for larger models and more complex tasks such as natural language processing or computer vision. Understanding the scalability of these findings is crucial for assessing their practical relevance. Secondly, can the authors provide a more detailed theoretical explanation for why certain initialization methods are more effective for grokking? While the paper provides some high-level explanations, a deeper analysis of the optimization dynamics and the spectral properties of the weight matrices is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, what is the relationship between the spectral properties of the weight matrices and the curvature of the loss landscape, and how does this affect the emergence of grokking? Thirdly, how do other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules and batch size, interact with weight initialization to affect grokking? The paper keeps these hyperparameters constant across different initialization methods, but it is possible that the optimal initialization method depends on the specific hyperparameter settings used during training. A more comprehensive study of these interactions is needed to provide a more complete understanding of the factors that influence grokking behavior. Finally, how do the findings of this study compare to similar research on weight initialization and grokking in other types of neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks? The paper focuses on Transformer models, but it is important to understand whether the observed effects of initialization are specific to Transformers or whether they generalize to other model architectures. A comparison to similar research in other neural network architectures would provide a broader context for the findings and help to determine the generalizability of the results.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",
                "summary": "This paper delves into the intriguing phenomenon of grokking in Transformer models, specifically investigating the impact of different weight initialization strategies on this behavior. The authors focus on arithmetic tasks within finite fields, a choice that allows for controlled experimentation and clear observation of the grokking phenomenon. They compare five distinct initialization methods: PyTorch's default, Xavier (Glorot), He, Orthogonal, and Kaiming Normal, across four arithmetic operations: modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation composition. The core methodology involves training small Transformer models with these various initializations and meticulously tracking the training and validation accuracy over time. The primary empirical finding is that the choice of initialization significantly influences the speed of convergence and the final generalization performance. Notably, the authors observed that Xavier initialization consistently leads to faster convergence and higher validation accuracy across the tested tasks, suggesting a particular suitability for inducing grokking in this context. The paper's contribution lies in highlighting the often-underappreciated role of weight initialization in the emergence of grokking, a phenomenon where models suddenly generalize well after a prolonged period of apparent memorization. While the paper provides a systematic empirical comparison, it does not delve deeply into the theoretical underpinnings of why certain initializations are more effective, nor does it explore the interaction of initialization with other hyperparameters. The study's focus on a small Transformer architecture and arithmetic tasks, while enabling controlled experimentation, also raises questions about the generalizability of the findings to larger models and more complex real-world scenarios. Despite these limitations, the paper offers valuable insights into the relationship between weight initialization and grokking, opening avenues for further research in this area. The authors' work underscores the importance of considering initialization strategies when training models prone to grokking, and it provides a foundation for future studies to build upon, particularly in the realm of theoretical analysis and practical applications.",

                "strengths": "This paper presents a clear and well-structured investigation into the impact of weight initialization on the grokking phenomenon in Transformer models. I found the research topic to be both timely and relevant, as grokking remains a poorly understood aspect of deep learning, and any insight into its mechanisms is valuable. The authors' decision to focus on arithmetic tasks in finite fields is a strength, as it provides a controlled environment for observing grokking, allowing for a more systematic analysis of the effects of different initialization methods. The experimental design is rigorous, with multiple runs and statistical validation to ensure the robustness of the results. The paper's systematic comparison of five different weight initialization methods is a significant contribution, offering valuable insights into their effects on grokking behavior. The authors clearly document their methodology, making the study reproducible, which is a crucial aspect of scientific research. The empirical findings are compelling, demonstrating that different initialization methods significantly affect the convergence speed and generalization capabilities of Transformer models. The observation that Xavier initialization consistently outperforms other methods in terms of faster convergence and higher validation accuracy is a key finding that warrants further investigation. The paper's focus on a novel and important problem in deep learning, specifically the impact of weight initialization on grokking, is a significant strength.

Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its clear research question, well-designed experiments, and significant empirical findings, which contribute to a better understanding of the grokking phenomenon.",
                "weaknesses": "After a thorough examination of the paper, I've identified several key weaknesses that significantly impact the scope and generalizability of the findings. Firstly, the experimental setup is limited by its small scale and the simplicity of the tasks. The authors employ a small Transformer architecture with only 2 layers, 128 model dimensions, and 4 attention heads (Section 3.1). This choice, while sufficient for observing grokking, does not explore the behavior of deeper or wider models, which might exhibit different sensitivities to initialization strategies. Furthermore, the study focuses on four specific arithmetic tasks within a finite field of prime order 97 (Section 3.1). While these tasks provide a controlled environment, they are a simplification of real-world problems where Transformers are typically applied. The use of modular arithmetic, in particular, may introduce specific properties that are not present in other types of computations, and it is unclear if the observed effects of initialization would be the same in other contexts. This limitation is further compounded by the fact that the paper does not provide any discussion on the potential limitations of the chosen architecture and task domain. The lack of exploration of different model sizes and task complexities limits the scope of the conclusions, making it difficult to ascertain whether the findings would generalize to larger models or more complex tasks such as natural language processing or computer vision. This is a significant concern, as the paper's conclusions are based on a very specific setup that may not be representative of the broader applications of Transformer models. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is directly supported by the explicit description of the experimental setup in Section 3.1. \n\nSecondly, the paper lacks a detailed theoretical explanation for why certain initialization methods are more effective for grokking. While the empirical results are compelling, the underlying mechanisms that cause Xavier initialization to outperform others remain unexplored. The paper includes a section titled \"5.6 Theoretical Analysis of Initialization Effects\" which provides high-level explanations related to Gradient Flow, Loss Landscape, and Feature Alignment. However, it does not include a detailed mathematical analysis or proof. Specifically, the paper does not delve into the spectral properties of the weight matrices initialized by each method, nor does it analyze how these properties might affect the optimization landscape and the emergence of grokking. For instance, it is not clear if certain initializations lead to a more favorable distribution of singular values, which could facilitate faster convergence and better generalization. The absence of such analysis leaves a gap in understanding the mechanisms at play. This lack of theoretical depth is a significant weakness, as it limits the paper's ability to provide a mechanistic understanding of the observed phenomena. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is evident from the absence of mathematical proofs or in-depth theoretical analysis beyond high-level explanations. \n\nThirdly, the paper does not explore the interaction between initialization methods and other hyperparameters, such as learning rate schedules or model architectures. The experiments are conducted with a fixed learning rate schedule and model architecture, which limits the understanding of how initialization interacts with these other factors. For instance, it is possible that the optimal initialization method depends on the learning rate or the depth of the network. A more comprehensive study would explore these interactions. The paper states, \"We use a batch size of 512 and train for a total of 7,500 update steps, with a warmup period of 50 steps for the learning rate scheduler\" (Section 3.1) and \"Learning rate schedule: Linear warmup over 50 steps, then constant\" (Section 5.3). The paper keeps the learning rate schedule and other hyperparameters constant across different initialization methods. This lack of exploration into the interplay between initialization and other hyperparameters is a significant limitation, as it prevents a more complete understanding of the factors that influence grokking behavior. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is directly supported by the experimental setup description in Sections 3.1 and 5.3. \n\nFinally, the paper does not provide concrete guidelines or tools for practitioners to apply the findings in real-world applications. While the results suggest that Xavier initialization is generally better for grokking, it is not clear how practitioners should choose initialization methods for their specific tasks. The paper lacks practical recommendations or a decision-making framework that could guide practitioners in selecting the appropriate initialization strategy. The conclusion summarizes the findings but does not offer specific, actionable guidelines or tools for practitioners. This lack of practical guidance limits the immediate impact of the research. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is evident from the absence of practical recommendations in the conclusion section.",
                "suggestions": "To address the identified weaknesses and enhance the impact of this research, I recommend several concrete improvements. Firstly, the authors should significantly expand the scope of their experiments to include larger Transformer models and more complex tasks. This would involve exploring the impact of initialization strategies on models with more layers, larger hidden dimensions, and different attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the behavior of these initialization methods on tasks beyond arithmetic, such as sequence-to-sequence tasks or tasks involving natural language understanding. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the generalizability of their findings. It would also be beneficial to explore the impact of different dataset sizes and complexities on the observed grokking phenomenon, as this could reveal how initialization interacts with the learning process under different data regimes. Such an analysis would significantly enhance the practical relevance of the study. Specifically, the authors could consider using benchmark datasets from natural language processing or computer vision to assess the performance of different initialization methods in more realistic scenarios. This would help to determine whether the observed trends hold for more complex tasks and larger models. \n\nSecondly, the authors should delve deeper into the theoretical underpinnings of their findings. This could involve analyzing the gradient dynamics during training, examining the loss landscape, and investigating the feature representations learned by different initialization methods. For example, the authors could analyze the singular values of the weight matrices to understand how different initializations affect the propagation of gradients. They could also visualize the loss landscape to see if certain initializations lead to smoother or more favorable optimization paths. Furthermore, the authors could explore the information content of the learned features to see if certain initializations lead to more efficient or robust representations. Such an analysis would provide a more mechanistic understanding of why certain initialization methods are more effective for grokking. Specifically, the authors should investigate the spectral properties of the weight matrices resulting from different initialization schemes. This could involve examining the distribution of singular values and eigenvalues of the weight matrices at initialization and how these properties evolve during training. For example, it would be beneficial to investigate whether certain initializations lead to a more balanced distribution of singular values, which could potentially facilitate better gradient flow and faster convergence. Furthermore, the authors could explore the relationship between the spectral properties of the weight matrices and the curvature of the loss landscape. This could provide insights into why certain initializations lead to better generalization performance. Such an analysis would move beyond purely empirical observations and provide a more mechanistic understanding of the observed phenomena. \n\nThirdly, the authors should explore the interaction between initialization methods and other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and batch size. It is possible that the optimal initialization method depends on the specific hyperparameter settings used during training. For example, certain initializations might be more robust to changes in the learning rate, while others might be more sensitive. By exploring these interactions, the authors could provide more practical guidance for practitioners who are looking to apply their findings in real-world settings. This would also help to further understand the mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena and how they are influenced by different training conditions. Specifically, the authors could perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how the optimal initialization method varies with different hyperparameter settings. This would provide valuable insights for practitioners seeking to apply these findings in real-world scenarios. \n\nFinally, the authors should provide more concrete guidelines for practitioners on how to apply their findings in real-world applications. This could involve developing a decision-making framework that takes into account the specific characteristics of the task, the model architecture, and the available computational resources. For example, the authors could provide recommendations on how to choose the appropriate initialization method based on the type of task, the size of the dataset, and the desired level of generalization. They could also develop tools or libraries that make it easier for practitioners to experiment with different initialization strategies. Such practical guidance would significantly increase the impact of the study and make it more useful for the broader machine learning community. This could involve creating a set of best practices or a checklist that practitioners can use to select the most appropriate initialization method for their specific use case.",
                "questions": "After reviewing the paper, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for further understanding the implications of this research.

The proposed method incorporates two parallel branches: a global branch and a local branch, with a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism. The experiments are conducted on four diverse 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n2\n\n### Contribution\n\n1\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear motivation.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n - The paper has limited novelty and contribution. The proposed method of using dual branches for low-dimensional data is very straightforward, without addressing any major challenges. The method can be considered as a simple extension of multi-resolution approaches.\n- The paper lacks a theoretical foundation. There is no mathematical explanation for why the proposed method works effectively for low-dimensional diffusion models. The authors should provide mathematical evidence to support the claims made in the paper.\n- The paper does not include a comparison with state-of-the-art methods, which makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach. \n- The experiments are conducted only on simple 2D datasets, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate the method's effectiveness on more complex, real-world data.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper's core weakness lies in its incremental contribution over existing multi-resolution techniques. While the authors propose a dual-branch architecture with adaptive weighting, the core idea of processing data at different scales is not novel. To strengthen the paper, the authors should explore more sophisticated methods for combining the global and local branches. For example, instead of a simple weighted sum, they could investigate attention mechanisms or learnable fusion layers that dynamically adjust the contribution of each branch based on the input data and timestep. Furthermore, the paper should provide a more detailed analysis of the limitations of existing multi-resolution methods in the context of low-dimensional diffusion models, and how the proposed approach specifically addresses these limitations. This would help to justify the novelty and significance of the contribution.\n\nTo address the lack of theoretical foundation, the authors should provide a more rigorous mathematical analysis of their method. This could involve deriving equations that describe the behavior of the global and local branches, and analyzing how the adaptive weighting mechanism affects the denoising process. Specifically, the authors should investigate the spectral properties of the diffusion operators at different scales, and how the proposed method balances the global and local feature representations. A theoretical analysis should also include a discussion of the stability and convergence properties of the proposed method. This would provide a deeper understanding of why the method works and how it compares to existing approaches. Without this theoretical grounding, the paper remains largely empirical and lacks the necessary depth to be considered a significant contribution.\n\nFinally, the paper needs a more comprehensive experimental evaluation. The current experiments on simple 2D datasets are insufficient to demonstrate the method's effectiveness on more complex, real-world data. The authors should include experiments on higher-dimensional datasets, such as those found in tabular data or molecular modeling. Furthermore, the paper should include a comparison with state-of-the-art methods for low-dimensional diffusion models. This would allow for a more objective assessment of the proposed method's performance. The authors should also explore the impact of different hyperparameter settings on the performance of the method, and provide guidelines for selecting optimal values. This would make the paper more useful to the research community.\n\n### Questions\n\n- What are the major challenges in using multi-resolution approaches for low-dimensional data? And how does the proposed method address these challenges?\n- What are the differences between using dual branches and multi-resolution approaches?\n- What are the differences between the proposed method and previous methods for low-dimensional diffusion models?\n- Can the proposed method be used for high-dimensional data?\n- What is the performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods on complex datasets such as tabular data or molecular modeling?\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces an adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for low-dimensional diffusion models, addressing the challenge of balancing global structure and local detail in generated samples. The proposed method incorporates two parallel branches: a global branch processing the original input and a local branch handling an upscaled version, with a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism dynamically balancing their contributions. The experiments are conducted on four diverse 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3\n\n### Presentation\n\n3\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n2. The proposed method is simple but effective.\n3. The results seem promising.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The proposed method is verified on simple datasets. How about its performance on complex datasets, like the tabular datasets in TabDDPM?\n2. The authors claim that their method can inform improvements in higher-dimensional domains. Could you provide some insights into how to apply your method to high-dimensional data?\n3. The proposed method increases the computational costs. Could you also report the FLOPs of your method compared to the baseline?\n4. Could you also report the Wasserstein distance and FID scores for the baseline and your method?\n5. The authors claim that the proposed method can inform improvements in higher-dimensional domains. Could you also provide some experimental results on 8D Gaussian mixtures and 10D Swiss roll as in TabDDPM?\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit from a more thorough evaluation on complex datasets. While the 2D datasets demonstrate the method's ability to balance global and local features, it's unclear how well this translates to higher-dimensional data with more intricate dependencies. Specifically, the authors should consider evaluating their method on tabular datasets, which often exhibit complex, non-linear relationships between features. This would provide a more robust assessment of the method's generalizability. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the performance of their method on datasets with varying levels of complexity, such as those with different numbers of modes or varying degrees of feature correlation. This would help to identify the limitations of the proposed approach and guide future research.\n\nRegarding the application to higher-dimensional data, the authors should provide more concrete details on how the dual-scale architecture can be adapted. Simply stating that the method can be extended is not sufficient. For example, in the context of image generation, how would the global and local branches be defined? Would the global branch operate on the full image, while the local branch focuses on smaller patches? What would be the upsampling strategy for the local branch? What would be the computational implications of such an approach? The authors should also discuss the potential challenges of applying their method to very high-dimensional data, such as the curse of dimensionality and the increased computational cost. A more detailed discussion of these issues would greatly enhance the paper's impact.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide a more comprehensive analysis of the computational cost of their method. While training time is a useful metric, it does not fully capture the computational overhead. Reporting FLOPs would provide a more detailed understanding of the method's computational complexity. Additionally, the authors should investigate the scalability of their method with respect to the dimensionality of the data and the number of diffusion steps. This would help to identify the practical limitations of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the trade-off between computational cost and performance. This would allow readers to make informed decisions about whether to use the proposed method in their own research.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease see the weakness.\n\n### Rating\n\n5\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 3\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper introduces a novel adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for low-dimensional diffusion models.

The proposed architecture incorporates two parallel branches: a global branch that processes the original input and a local branch that handles an upscaled version of the input. A key innovation is the learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism that dynamically balances the contributions of these two branches throughout the denoising process. The authors evaluate their method on four diverse 2D datasets (circle, dino, line, and moons) and demonstrate significant improvements in sample quality, with KL divergence reductions of up to 12.8% compared to the baseline model.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3\n\n### Presentation\n\n3\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper introduces an innovative adaptive dual-scale denoising architecture specifically designed for low-dimensional diffusion models. This approach is novel in its ability to dynamically balance global structure and local details, which is a significant advancement for generative modeling in low-dimensional spaces.\n2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their method on four diverse 2D datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and generation fidelity.

The authors effectively communicate the motivation behind their work, the technical details of their approach, and the implications of their findings.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper primarily focuses on low-dimensional data, which may limit its applicability to high-dimensional domains such as image synthesis or 3D shape generation. While the authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest future work in extending their approach to higher dimensions, the current scope may not fully address the needs of researchers working with more complex data. Specifically, the paper lacks a discussion on how the proposed dual-scale architecture would scale with the increased dimensionality of images or 3D models, where the notion of 'local detail' becomes significantly more complex and computationally expensive to capture. The current evaluation on 2D datasets does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that this method can be effectively generalized to higher-dimensional problems.\n2. The adaptive weighting mechanism, while innovative, introduces additional complexity to the model. This may result in increased computational costs and longer training times compared to traditional single-scale diffusion models. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the dual-branch architecture and the adaptive weighting mechanism. A more thorough investigation into the number of parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage would be beneficial to understand the practical implications of this added complexity. Furthermore, the paper does not explore potential optimizations to mitigate the increased computational burden.\n3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed method. For instance, the authors could explore scenarios where the adaptive dual-scale approach might underperform or fail. This would provide a more balanced view of the method's capabilities and help guide future research. For example, it would be valuable to investigate how the method performs on datasets with highly irregular or fragmented structures, where the distinction between global and local features might be less clear. Additionally, the paper should discuss the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameter settings, particularly those related to the adaptive weighting mechanism.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit from a more thorough investigation into the scalability of the proposed dual-scale architecture. While the current results on 2D datasets are promising, it is crucial to address the challenges of applying this method to higher-dimensional data. The authors should consider exploring different strategies for defining 'local detail' in higher dimensions, such as using convolutional layers with varying receptive fields or employing hierarchical downsampling techniques. Furthermore, the paper should include a discussion on the computational cost of these strategies and how they compare to existing methods for high-dimensional diffusion models. It would also be beneficial to investigate the performance of the method on datasets with varying levels of complexity, including those with more intricate structures and higher dimensionality, to better understand its limitations and potential for generalization. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's applicability to real-world problems.\n\nTo address the computational overhead of the adaptive weighting mechanism, the authors should explore potential optimizations. This could include techniques such as pruning or quantization to reduce the number of parameters in the weighting network, or using more efficient activation functions. Additionally, the paper should provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, including the number of parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage, and compare it to existing diffusion models. This analysis should also consider the impact of different hyperparameter settings on the computational cost. Furthermore, the authors could investigate the possibility of using a fixed weighting scheme, where the weights are pre-determined based on the dataset or task, to reduce the computational burden. This would provide a more practical approach for applications where computational resources are limited.\n\nFinally, the paper should include a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed method. This should include an investigation into scenarios where the adaptive dual-scale approach might underperform or fail, such as datasets with highly irregular or fragmented structures. The authors should also explore the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameter settings, particularly those related to the adaptive weighting mechanism. This would provide a more balanced view of the method's capabilities and help guide future research. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the potential for overfitting, especially when dealing with small datasets, and explore techniques to mitigate this issue, such as data augmentation or regularization. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's limitations and potential for improvement.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

The analysis of weight evolution patterns provides valuable insights into the denoising process, enhancing the understanding of how the model balances global and local features.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing multi-scale diffusion models, which could provide a clearer understanding of the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach. Specifically, the paper does not discuss how the proposed method compares to other techniques that also aim to capture both global and local features, such as those employing hierarchical or multi-scale architectures. A more thorough analysis of the differences in methodology and performance would be beneficial.\n2. The method's performance on higher-dimensional data is not explored, leaving uncertainty about its scalability and applicability to more complex datasets. The current evaluation is limited to 2D datasets, and it is unclear how the dual-scale architecture and adaptive weighting mechanism would perform with increased dimensionality. The computational cost and potential for overfitting in higher dimensions should be addressed.\n3. The computational overhead introduced by the dual-scale architecture and adaptive weighting mechanism is not thoroughly analyzed, which could be a concern for practical applications. While the paper mentions the dual branches, it does not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational cost associated with each component, such as the global and local branches, and the adaptive weighting network. A quantitative analysis of the increase in parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage is needed to assess the practical feasibility of the method.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo strengthen the paper, the authors should provide a more detailed comparison with existing multi-scale diffusion models. This should include a discussion of the specific architectural differences, training methodologies, and performance trade-offs. For example, the authors could compare their approach to methods that use hierarchical diffusion processes or those that employ separate networks for different scales. A quantitative comparison, if possible, or a qualitative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach would be valuable. This would help to contextualize the contribution of the proposed method and highlight its unique advantages. Furthermore, the authors should discuss how their method addresses the limitations of existing multi-scale approaches, such as potential artifacts or inconsistencies between scales.\n\nTo address the concern about scalability, the authors should conduct experiments on higher-dimensional datasets. This could include synthetic datasets with varying dimensionality or real-world datasets with more complex structures. The analysis should focus on the performance of the method in terms of sample quality, KL divergence, and computational cost. It would be beneficial to investigate how the dual-scale architecture and adaptive weighting mechanism behave with increased dimensionality. For example, do the weights converge to a stable solution, or do they exhibit oscillations? Does the method suffer from overfitting or increased computational cost? The authors should also discuss the limitations of their method in higher dimensions and suggest potential solutions or future research directions. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the applicability of the proposed method.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by their method. This should include a breakdown of the computational cost associated with each component, such as the global and local branches, and the adaptive weighting network. The analysis should quantify the increase in parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage compared to a standard single-scale diffusion model. The authors should also discuss the practical implications of this overhead, such as the impact on training time and inference speed. It would be beneficial to explore potential optimizations or trade-offs that could reduce the computational cost without sacrificing performance. This would make the method more practical for real-world applications.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

Next, I will generate verification content for these reviews:\n\n\\boxed_verification{\nThe user wants me to validate weaknesses identified by reviewers in the provided paper. I need to go through each reviewer's comments and find evidence in the paper to support their claims.\n\nPlan:\n1. Read each reviewer's weakness.\n2. Search the paper for evidence related to the weakness.\n3. Categorize the evidence (method, experiment, literature).\n4. Write a validation analysis for each weakness.\n**Review 1 Weaknesses:**\n\n1. Weakness Statement: The paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing multi-scale diffusion models, which could provide a clearer understanding of the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach. Specifically, the paper does not discuss how the proposed method compares to other techniques that also aim to capture both global and local features, such as those employing hierarchical or multi-scale architectures. A more thorough analysis of the differences in methodology and performance would be beneficial.\n\n2.

Weakness Statement: The paper primarily focuses on low-dimensional data, which may limit its applicability to high-dimensional domains such as image synthesis or 3D shape generation. While the authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest future work in extending their approach to higher dimensions, the current scope may not fully address the needs of researchers working with more complex data.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces an innovative dual-scale denoising architecture for low-dimensional diffusion models, aiming to enhance the balance between global structure and local details in generated samples. The core idea revolves around a dual-branch network, where one branch processes the original input to capture global features, while the other branch processes an upscaled version of the input to focus on local details. A key contribution is the introduction of a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contributions of these two branches throughout the denoising process. This adaptive weighting allows the model to flexibly balance global and local information based on the specific timestep and input, which is a significant departure from traditional multi-scale methods that often rely on fixed hierarchies or sequences of models. The authors evaluate their method on four diverse 2D datasets—circle, dino, line, and moons—demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and a reduction in KL divergence compared to baseline models. The paper also includes an analysis of the weight evolution patterns, providing valuable insights into the denoising process and how the model balances global and local features. The authors acknowledge that their work is primarily focused on low-dimensional data and suggest future work to extend their approach to higher-dimensional data, potentially leading to improvements in areas such as image synthesis, 3D shape generation, or modeling molecular structures for drug discovery. The paper's main contribution lies in the novel adaptive dual-scale architecture and its application to low-dimensional diffusion models, offering a promising approach for improving generative modeling in this domain. The empirical results, while limited to 2D datasets, show clear improvements over the baseline, and the analysis of weight evolution provides a deeper understanding of the method's behavior. The authors also provide a detailed description of the method, making it accessible to readers across different backgrounds. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of diffusion models, particularly in the context of low-dimensional data, and opens up avenues for future research in this area.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe primary strength of this paper lies in its innovative approach to balancing global and local features in low-dimensional diffusion models through an adaptive dual-scale architecture. The proposed method introduces a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contributions of the global and local branches, which is a significant advancement over traditional multi-scale methods that rely on fixed hierarchies. This adaptive approach allows the model to flexibly balance global and local information based on the specific timestep and input, leading to improved sample quality. The paper's empirical evaluations on four diverse 2D datasets (circle, dino, line, and moons) demonstrate clear improvements in sample quality and a reduction in KL divergence compared to baseline models, including a standard DDPM and TabDDPM. The inclusion of the 'Fixed Weighting' baseline provides a useful comparison, highlighting the effectiveness of the adaptive weighting mechanism. Furthermore, the analysis of weight evolution patterns offers valuable insights into the denoising process, enhancing the understanding of how the model balances global and local features. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to readers across different backgrounds. The authors effectively communicate the motivation behind their work, the technical details of their approach, and the implications of their findings. The method is presented in a clear and concise manner, and the experimental setup is well-described. The results are presented in a way that is easy to understand, and the analysis of the results is thorough and insightful. The paper also acknowledges the limitations of the current work and suggests future directions for research, which is a sign of good scientific practice. The authors' recognition of the need to extend their approach to higher-dimensional data demonstrates a clear understanding of the broader context of their work. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of diffusion models, particularly in the context of low-dimensional data, and opens up avenues for future research in this area.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile the paper presents a novel approach with promising results, several weaknesses warrant careful consideration. Firstly, the paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing multi-scale diffusion models. While the authors acknowledge multi-scale approaches in Section 2.1, the discussion is limited to a few examples, such as Karras et al. (2022a) and Ho et al. (2021). The paper does not delve into a thorough analysis of the specific differences in methodology and performance trade-offs compared to a broader range of multi-scale techniques. For instance, the paper could have compared its approach to methods that use hierarchical diffusion processes or those that employ separate networks for different scales. This lack of detailed comparison makes it difficult to fully understand the advantages and limitations of the proposed method in the context of existing work. The paper includes a 'Fixed Weighting' baseline, which provides some comparison, but this is not a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's discussion of multi-scale methods is brief and lacks a detailed comparative analysis. Secondly, the paper's evaluation is primarily limited to simple 2D datasets. While the authors include 'Extended benchmarks' such as 8D Gaussian mixtures and 10D Swiss roll, the detailed results and analysis focus almost exclusively on the 2D datasets (circle, dino, line, moons). This raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method to more complex, real-world data. The paper does not provide detailed results for the higher-dimensional datasets, leaving uncertainty about the method's performance in these settings. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest future work on higher-dimensional data, but the lack of experimental results in this area is a significant weakness. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's results section clearly prioritizes 2D datasets and lacks detailed analysis of higher-dimensional data. Thirdly, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the dual-scale architecture and adaptive weighting mechanism. While the paper reports training and inference times in Table 1 and acknowledges that the improved performance comes at the cost of increased computational complexity, it does not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational cost associated with each component, such as the global and local branches, and the adaptive weighting network. A quantitative analysis of the increase in parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage is needed to assess the practical feasibility of the method. The paper does not explore potential optimizations to mitigate the increased computational burden. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper lacks a detailed computational analysis beyond training and inference times. Fourthly, the paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation. While the paper provides mathematical formulations for the diffusion process and the weighting mechanism, it does not offer a deeper theoretical explanation for *why* this specific architecture and weighting are effective in low-dimensional spaces. The paper focuses more on the empirical demonstration of the method's effectiveness. The theoretical contributions mentioned in the conclusion are future work, not currently present. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's theoretical contributions are explicitly stated as future work. Finally, the paper does not provide a detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed method. While the paper includes a 'LIMITATIONS' section, it does not explore scenarios where the adaptive dual-scale approach might underperform or fail, such as datasets with highly irregular or fragmented structures. The paper also does not thoroughly analyze the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameter settings, particularly those related to the adaptive weighting mechanism. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's discussion of limitations is brief and lacks a detailed analysis of potential failure scenarios and hyperparameter sensitivity.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should conduct a more thorough comparison with existing multi-scale diffusion models. This should include a detailed analysis of the specific architectural differences, training methodologies, and performance trade-offs between the proposed method and a wider range of multi-scale techniques. For example, the authors could compare their approach to methods that use hierarchical diffusion processes or those that employ separate networks for different scales. A quantitative comparison, if possible, or a qualitative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach would be valuable. This would help to contextualize the contribution of the proposed method and highlight its unique advantages. Furthermore, the authors should discuss how their method addresses the limitations of existing multi-scale approaches, such as potential artifacts or inconsistencies between scales. Second, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include more complex, real-world datasets. This should include datasets with varying levels of complexity, such as those with different numbers of modes or varying degrees of feature correlation. Specifically, the authors should provide detailed results for the higher-dimensional datasets mentioned in the experimental setup, such as the 8D Gaussian mixtures and 10D Swiss roll. This would help to assess the generalizability of the proposed method and identify its limitations. The authors should also consider evaluating their method on tabular datasets, which often exhibit complex, non-linear relationships between features. This would provide a more robust assessment of the method's generalizability. Third, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by their method. This should include a breakdown of the computational cost associated with each component, such as the global and local branches, and the adaptive weighting network. The analysis should quantify the increase in parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage compared to a standard single-scale diffusion model. The authors should also discuss the practical implications of this overhead, such as the impact on training time and inference speed. It would be beneficial to explore potential optimizations or trade-offs that could reduce the computational cost without sacrificing performance. This could include techniques such as pruning or quantization to reduce the number of parameters in the weighting network, or using more efficient activation functions. Fourth, the authors should provide a more rigorous theoretical analysis of their method. This could involve deriving equations that describe the behavior of the global and local branches, and analyzing how the adaptive weighting mechanism affects the denoising process. Specifically, the authors should investigate the spectral properties of the diffusion operators at different scales, and how the proposed method balances the global and local feature representations. A theoretical analysis should also include a discussion of the stability and convergence properties of the proposed method. This would provide a deeper understanding of why the method works and how it compares to existing approaches. Finally, the authors should include a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed method.

The authors should also explore the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameter settings, particularly those related to the adaptive weighting mechanism.

The proposed method of using dual branches for low-dimensional data is very straightforward, without addressing any major challenges. The method can be considered as a simple extension of multi-resolution approaches.\n- The paper lacks a theoretical foundation. There is no mathematical explanation for why the proposed method works effectively for low-dimensional diffusion models. The authors should provide mathematical evidence to support the claims made in the paper.\n- The paper does not include a comparison with state-of-the-art methods, which makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach. \n- The experiments are conducted only on simple 2D datasets, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate the method's effectiveness on more complex, real-world data.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper's core weakness lies in its incremental contribution over existing multi-resolution techniques. While the authors propose a dual-branch architecture with adaptive weighting, the core idea of processing data at different scales is not novel. To strengthen the paper, the authors should explore more sophisticated methods for combining the global and local branches. For example, instead of a simple weighted sum, they could investigate attention mechanisms or learnable fusion layers that dynamically adjust the contribution of each branch based on the input data and timestep. Furthermore, the paper should provide a more detailed analysis of the limitations of existing multi-resolution methods in the context of low-dimensional diffusion models, and how the proposed approach specifically addresses these limitations. This would help to justify the novelty and significance of the contribution.\n\nTo address the lack of theoretical foundation, the authors should provide a more rigorous mathematical analysis of their method. This could involve deriving equations that describe the behavior of the global and local branches, and analyzing how the adaptive weighting mechanism affects the denoising process. Specifically, the authors should investigate the spectral properties of the diffusion operators at different scales, and how the proposed method balances the global and local feature representations. A theoretical analysis should also include a discussion of the stability and convergence properties of the proposed method. This would provide a deeper understanding of why the method works and how it compares to existing approaches. Without this theoretical grounding, the paper remains largely empirical and lacks the necessary depth to be considered a significant contribution.\n\nFinally, the paper needs a more comprehensive experimental evaluation. The current experiments on simple 2D datasets are insufficient to demonstrate the method's effectiveness on more complex, real-world data. The authors should include experiments on higher-dimensional datasets, such as those found in tabular data or molecular modeling. Furthermore, the paper should include a comparison with state-of-the-art methods for low-dimensional diffusion models. This would allow for a more objective assessment of the proposed method's performance. The authors should also explore the impact of different hyperparameter settings on the performance of the method, and provide guidelines for selecting optimal values. This would make the paper more useful to the research community.\n\n### Questions\n\n- What are the major challenges in using multi-resolution approaches for low-dimensional data?

The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n2. The proposed method is simple but effective.\n3. The results seem promising.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The proposed method is verified on simple datasets. How about its performance on complex datasets, like the tabular datasets in TabDDPM?\n2. The authors claim that their method can inform improvements in higher-dimensional domains. Could you provide some insights into how to apply your method to high-dimensional data?\n3. The proposed method increases the computational costs. Could you also report the FLOPs of your method compared to the baseline?\n4. Could you also report the Wasserstein distance and FID scores for the baseline and your method?\n5. The authors claim that the proposed method can inform improvements in higher-dimensional domains. Could you also provide some experimental results on 8D Gaussian mixtures and 10D Swiss roll as in TabDDPM?\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit from a more thorough evaluation on complex datasets. While the 2D datasets demonstrate the method's ability to balance global and local features, it's unclear how well this translates to higher-dimensional data with more intricate dependencies. Specifically, the authors should consider evaluating their method on tabular datasets, which often exhibit complex, non-linear relationships between features. This would provide a more robust assessment of the method's generalizability. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the performance of their method on datasets with varying levels of complexity, such as those with different numbers of modes or varying degrees of feature correlation. This would help to identify the limitations of the proposed approach and guide future research.\n\nRegarding the application to higher-dimensional data, the authors should provide more concrete details on how the dual-scale architecture can be adapted. Simply stating that the method can be extended is not sufficient. For example, in the context of image generation, how would the global and local branches be defined? Would the global branch operate on the full image, while the local branch focuses on smaller patches? What would be the upsampling strategy for the local branch? What would be the computational implications of such an approach? The authors should also discuss the potential challenges of applying their method to very high-dimensional data, such as the curse of dimensionality and the increased computational cost. A more detailed discussion of these issues would greatly enhance the paper's impact.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide a more comprehensive analysis of the computational cost of their method. While training time is a useful metric, it does not fully capture the computational overhead. Reporting FLOPs would provide a more detailed understanding of the method's computational complexity. Additionally, the authors should investigate the scalability of their method with respect to the dimensionality of the data and the number of diffusion steps. This would help to identify the practical limitations of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the trade-off between computational cost and performance. This would allow readers to make informed decisions about whether to use the proposed method in their own research.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease see the weakness.\n\n### Rating\n\n5\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********"

The paper primarily focuses on low-dimensional data, which may limit its applicability to high-dimensional domains such as image synthesis or 3D shape generation. While the authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest future work in extending their approach to higher dimensions, the current scope may not fully address the needs of researchers working with more complex data. Specifically, the paper lacks a discussion on how the proposed dual-scale architecture would scale with the increased dimensionality of images or 3D models, where the notion of 'local detail' becomes significantly more complex and computationally expensive to capture. The current evaluation on 2D datasets does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that this method can be effectively generalized to higher-dimensional problems.\n2. The adaptive weighting mechanism, while innovative, introduces additional complexity to the model. This may result in increased computational costs and longer training times compared to traditional single-scale diffusion models. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the dual-branch architecture and the adaptive weighting mechanism. A more thorough investigation into the number of parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage would be beneficial to understand the practical implications of this added complexity. Furthermore, the paper does not explore potential optimizations to mitigate the increased computational burden.\n3.

For instance, the authors could explore scenarios where the adaptive dual-scale approach might underperform or fail. This would provide a more balanced view of the method's capabilities and help guide future research.

Additionally, the paper should discuss the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameter settings, particularly those related to the adaptive weighting mechanism.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit from a more thorough investigation into the scalability of the proposed dual-scale architecture. While the current results on 2D datasets are promising, it is crucial to address the challenges of applying this method to higher-dimensional data. The authors should consider exploring different strategies for defining 'local detail' in higher dimensions, such as using convolutional layers with varying receptive fields or employing hierarchical downsampling techniques. Furthermore, the paper should include a discussion on the computational cost of these strategies and how they compare to existing methods for high-dimensional diffusion models. It would also be beneficial to investigate the performance of the method on datasets with varying levels of complexity, including those with more intricate structures and higher dimensionality, to better understand its limitations and potential for generalization. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's applicability to real-world problems.\n\nTo address the computational overhead of the adaptive weighting mechanism, the authors should explore potential optimizations.

Additionally, the paper should provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, including the number of parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage, and compare it to existing diffusion models. This analysis should also consider the impact of different hyperparameter settings on the computational cost. Furthermore, the authors could investigate the possibility of using a fixed weighting scheme, where the weights are pre-determined based on the dataset or task, to reduce the computational burden. This would provide a more practical approach for applications where computational resources are limited.\n\nFinally, the paper should include a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed method.

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces an innovative dual-scale denoising architecture for low-dimensional diffusion models, aiming to enhance the balance between global structure and local details in generated samples. The core idea revolves around a dual-branch network, where one branch processes the original input to capture global features, while the other branch processes an upscaled version of the input to focus on local details. A key contribution is the introduction of a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contributions of these two branches throughout the denoising process. This adaptive weighting allows the model to flexibly balance global and local information based on the specific timestep and input, which is a significant departure from traditional multi-scale methods that often rely on fixed hierarchies or sequences of models. The authors evaluate their method on four diverse 2D datasets—circle, dino, line, and moons—demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and a reduction in KL divergence compared to baseline models. The paper also includes an analysis of the weight evolution patterns, providing valuable insights into the denoising process and how the model balances global and local features. The authors acknowledge that their work is primarily focused on low-dimensional data and suggest future work to extend their approach to higher-dimensional data, potentially leading to improvements in areas such as image synthesis, 3D shape generation, or modeling molecular structures for drug discovery. The paper's main contribution lies in the novel adaptive dual-scale architecture and its application to low-dimensional diffusion models, offering a promising approach for improving generative modeling in this domain. The empirical results, while limited to 2D datasets, show clear improvements over the baseline, and the analysis of weight evolution provides a deeper understanding of the method's behavior. The authors also provide a detailed description of the method, making it accessible to readers across different backgrounds. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of diffusion models, particularly in the context of low-dimensional data, and opens up avenues for future research in this area.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThe primary strength of this paper lies in its innovative approach to balancing global and local features in low-dimensional diffusion models through an adaptive dual-scale architecture. The proposed method introduces a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contributions of the global and local branches, which is a significant advancement over traditional multi-scale methods that rely on fixed hierarchies. This adaptive approach allows the model to flexibly balance global and local information based on the specific timestep and input, leading to improved sample quality. The paper's empirical evaluations on four diverse 2D datasets (circle, dino, line, and moons) demonstrate clear improvements in sample quality and a reduction in KL divergence compared to baseline models, including a standard DDPM and TabDDPM. The inclusion of the 'Fixed Weighting' baseline provides a useful comparison, highlighting the effectiveness of the adaptive weighting mechanism. Furthermore, the analysis of weight evolution patterns offers valuable insights into the denoising process, enhancing the understanding of how the model balances global and local features. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to readers across different backgrounds. The authors effectively communicate the motivation behind their work, the technical details of their approach, and the implications of their findings. The method is presented in a clear and concise manner, and the experimental setup is well-described. The results are presented in a way that is easy to understand, and the analysis of the results is thorough and insightful. The paper also acknowledges the limitations of the current work and suggests future directions for research, which is a sign of good scientific practice. The authors' recognition of the need to extend their approach to higher-dimensional data demonstrates a clear understanding of the broader context of their work. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of diffusion models, particularly in the context of low-dimensional data, and opens up avenues for future research in this area.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile the paper presents a novel approach with promising results, several weaknesses warrant careful consideration. Firstly, the paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing multi-scale diffusion models. While the authors acknowledge multi-scale approaches in Section 2.1, the discussion is limited to a few examples, such as Karras et al. (2022a) and Ho et al. (2021). The paper does not delve into a thorough analysis of the specific differences in methodology and performance trade-offs compared to a broader range of multi-scale techniques. For instance, the paper could have compared its approach to methods that use hierarchical diffusion processes or those that employ separate networks for different scales. This lack of detailed comparison makes it difficult to fully understand the advantages and limitations of the proposed method in the context of existing work. The paper includes a 'Fixed Weighting' baseline, which provides some comparison, but this is not a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's discussion of multi-scale methods is brief and lacks a detailed comparative analysis. Secondly, the paper's evaluation is primarily limited to simple 2D datasets. While the authors include 'Extended benchmarks' such as 8D Gaussian mixtures and 10D Swiss roll, the detailed results and analysis focus almost exclusively on the 2D datasets (circle, dino, line, moons). This raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method to more complex, real-world data. The paper does not provide detailed results for the higher-dimensional datasets, leaving uncertainty about the method's performance in these settings. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest future work on higher-dimensional data, but the lack of experimental results in this area is a significant weakness. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's results section clearly prioritizes 2D datasets and lacks detailed analysis of higher-dimensional data. Thirdly, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the dual-scale architecture and adaptive weighting mechanism. While the paper reports training and inference times in Table 1 and acknowledges that the improved performance comes at the cost of increased computational complexity, it does not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational cost associated with each component, such as the global and local branches, and the adaptive weighting network. A quantitative analysis of the increase in parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage is needed to assess the practical feasibility of the method. The paper does not explore potential optimizations to mitigate the increased computational burden. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper lacks a detailed computational analysis beyond training and inference times. Fourthly, the paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation. While the paper provides mathematical formulations for the diffusion process and the weighting mechanism, it does not offer a deeper theoretical explanation for *why* this specific architecture and weighting are effective in low-dimensional spaces. The paper focuses more on the empirical demonstration of the method's effectiveness. The theoretical contributions mentioned in the conclusion are future work, not currently present. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's theoretical contributions are explicitly stated as future work. Finally, the paper does not provide a detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed method. While the paper includes a 'LIMITATIONS' section, it does not explore scenarios where the adaptive dual-scale approach might underperform or fail, such as datasets with highly irregular or fragmented structures. The paper also does not thoroughly analyze the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameter settings, particularly those related to the adaptive weighting mechanism. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's discussion of limitations is brief and lacks a detailed analysis of potential failure scenarios and hyperparameter sensitivity.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should conduct a more thorough comparison with existing multi-scale diffusion models. This should include a detailed analysis of the specific architectural differences, training methodologies, and performance trade-offs between the proposed method and a wider range of multi-scale techniques. For example, the authors could compare their approach to methods that use hierarchical diffusion processes or those that employ separate networks for different scales. A quantitative comparison, if possible, or a qualitative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach would be valuable. This would help to contextualize the contribution of the proposed method and highlight its unique advantages. Furthermore, the authors should discuss how their method addresses the limitations of existing multi-scale approaches, such as potential artifacts or inconsistencies between scales. Second, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include more complex, real-world datasets. This should include datasets with varying levels of complexity, such as those with different numbers of modes or varying degrees of feature correlation. Specifically, the authors should provide detailed results for the higher-dimensional datasets mentioned in the experimental setup, such as the 8D Gaussian mixtures and 10D Swiss roll. This would help to assess the generalizability of the proposed method and identify its limitations. The authors should also consider evaluating their method on tabular datasets, which often exhibit complex, non-linear relationships between features. This would provide a more robust assessment of the method's generalizability. Third, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by their method. This should include a breakdown of the computational cost associated with each component, such as the global and local branches, and the adaptive weighting network. The analysis should quantify the increase in parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage compared to a standard single-scale diffusion model. The authors should also discuss the practical implications of this overhead, such as the impact on training time and inference speed. It would be beneficial to explore potential optimizations or trade-offs that could reduce the computational cost without sacrificing performance. This could include techniques such as pruning or quantization to reduce the number of parameters in the weighting network, or using more efficient activation functions. Fourth, the authors should provide a more rigorous theoretical analysis of their method. This could involve deriving equations that describe the behavior of the global and local branches, and analyzing how the adaptive weighting mechanism affects the denoising process. Specifically, the authors should investigate the spectral properties of the diffusion operators at different scales, and how the proposed method balances the global and local feature representations. A theoretical analysis should also include a discussion of the stability and convergence properties of the proposed method. This would provide a deeper understanding of why the method works and how it compares to existing approaches. Finally, the authors should include a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed method. This should include an investigation into scenarios where the adaptive dual-scale approach might underperform or fail, such as datasets with highly irregular or fragmented structures. The authors should also explore the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameter settings, particularly those related to the adaptive weighting mechanism. This would provide a more balanced view of the method's capabilities and help guide future research. Furthermore, the authors should discuss the potential for overfitting, especially when dealing with small datasets, and explore techniques to mitigate this issue, such as data augmentation or regularization.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nSeveral key questions arise from my analysis of this paper. First, how does the proposed adaptive dual-scale denoising approach perform on high-dimensional datasets, such as images or 3D shapes? Are there any preliminary results or insights that suggest its effectiveness in these domains?

                "summary": "This paper introduces an innovative dual-scale denoising architecture for low-dimensional diffusion models, aiming to enhance the balance between global structure and local details in generated samples. The core idea revolves around a dual-branch network, where one branch processes the original input to capture global features, while the other branch processes an upscaled version of the input to focus on local details. A key contribution is the introduction of a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contributions of these two branches throughout the denoising process. This adaptive weighting allows the model to flexibly balance global and local information based on the specific timestep and input, which is a significant departure from traditional multi-scale methods that often rely on fixed hierarchies or sequences of models. The authors evaluate their method on four diverse 2D datasets—circle, dino, line, and moons—demonstrating significant improvements in sample quality and a reduction in KL divergence compared to baseline models. The paper also includes an analysis of the weight evolution patterns, providing valuable insights into the denoising process and how the model balances global and local features. The authors acknowledge that their work is primarily focused on low-dimensional data and suggest future work to extend their approach to higher-dimensional data, potentially leading to improvements in areas such as image synthesis, 3D shape generation, or modeling molecular structures for drug discovery. The paper's main contribution lies in the novel adaptive dual-scale architecture and its application to low-dimensional diffusion models, offering a promising approach for improving generative modeling in this domain. The empirical results, while limited to 2D datasets, show clear improvements over the baseline, and the analysis of weight evolution provides a deeper understanding of the method's behavior. The authors also provide a detailed description of the method, making it accessible to readers across different backgrounds. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of diffusion models, particularly in the context of low-dimensional data, and opens up avenues for future research in this area.",

The proposed method introduces a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contributions of the global and local branches, which is a significant advancement over traditional multi-scale methods that rely on fixed hierarchies. This adaptive approach allows the model to flexibly balance global and local information based on the specific timestep and input, leading to improved sample quality. The paper's empirical evaluations on four diverse 2D datasets (circle, dino, line, and moons) demonstrate clear improvements in sample quality and a reduction in KL divergence compared to baseline models, including a standard DDPM and TabDDPM.

                "weaknesses": "While the paper presents a novel approach with promising results, several weaknesses warrant careful consideration. Firstly, the paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing multi-scale diffusion models. While the authors acknowledge multi-scale approaches in Section 2.1, the discussion is limited to a few examples, such as Karras et al. (2022a) and Ho et al. (2021). The paper does not delve into a thorough analysis of the specific differences in methodology and performance trade-offs compared to a broader range of multi-scale techniques. For instance, the paper could have compared its approach to methods that use hierarchical diffusion processes or those that employ separate networks for different scales. This lack of detailed comparison makes it difficult to fully understand the advantages and limitations of the proposed method in the context of existing work. The paper includes a 'Fixed Weighting' baseline, which provides some comparison, but this is not a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's discussion of multi-scale methods is brief and lacks a detailed comparative analysis. Secondly, the paper's evaluation is primarily limited to simple 2D datasets. While the authors include 'Extended benchmarks' such as 8D Gaussian mixtures and 10D Swiss roll, the detailed results and analysis focus almost exclusively on the 2D datasets (circle, dino, line, moons). This raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method to more complex, real-world data. The paper does not provide detailed results for the higher-dimensional datasets, leaving uncertainty about the method's performance in these settings. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest future work on higher-dimensional data, but the lack of experimental results in this area is a significant weakness. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's results section clearly prioritizes 2D datasets and lacks detailed analysis of higher-dimensional data. Thirdly, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the dual-scale architecture and adaptive weighting mechanism. While the paper reports training and inference times in Table 1 and acknowledges that the improved performance comes at the cost of increased computational complexity, it does not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational cost associated with each component, such as the global and local branches, and the adaptive weighting network. A quantitative analysis of the increase in parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage is needed to assess the practical feasibility of the method. The paper does not explore potential optimizations to mitigate the increased computational burden. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper lacks a detailed computational analysis beyond training and inference times. Fourthly, the paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation. While the paper provides mathematical formulations for the diffusion process and the weighting mechanism, it does not offer a deeper theoretical explanation for *why* this specific architecture and weighting are effective in low-dimensional spaces. The paper focuses more on the empirical demonstration of the method's effectiveness. The theoretical contributions mentioned in the conclusion are future work, not currently present. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's theoretical contributions are explicitly stated as future work. Finally, the paper does not provide a detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed method. While the paper includes a 'LIMITATIONS' section, it does not explore scenarios where the adaptive dual-scale approach might underperform or fail, such as datasets with highly irregular or fragmented structures. The paper also does not thoroughly analyze the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameter settings, particularly those related to the adaptive weighting mechanism. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's discussion of limitations is brief and lacks a detailed analysis of potential failure scenarios and hyperparameter sensitivity.",
                "suggestions": "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should conduct a more thorough comparison with existing multi-scale diffusion models. This should include a detailed analysis of the specific architectural differences, training methodologies, and performance trade-offs between the proposed method and a wider range of multi-scale techniques. For example, the authors could compare their approach to methods that use hierarchical diffusion processes or those that employ separate networks for different scales. A quantitative comparison, if possible, or a qualitative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach would be valuable. This would help to contextualize the contribution of the proposed method and highlight its unique advantages. Furthermore, the authors should discuss how their method addresses the limitations of existing multi-scale approaches, such as potential artifacts or inconsistencies between scales. Second, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include more complex, real-world datasets. This should include datasets with varying levels of complexity, such as those with different numbers of modes or varying degrees of feature correlation. Specifically, the authors should provide detailed results for the higher-dimensional datasets mentioned in the experimental setup, such as the 8D Gaussian mixtures and 10D Swiss roll. This would help to assess the generalizability of the proposed method and identify its limitations. The authors should also consider evaluating their method on tabular datasets, which often exhibit complex, non-linear relationships between features. This would provide a more robust assessment of the method's generalizability. Third, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by their method. This should include a breakdown of the computational cost associated with each component, such as the global and local branches, and the adaptive weighting network. The analysis should quantify the increase in parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage compared to a standard single-scale diffusion model. The authors should also discuss the practical implications of this overhead, such as the impact on training time and inference speed. It would be beneficial to explore potential optimizations or trade-offs that could reduce the computational cost without sacrificing performance. This could include techniques such as pruning or quantization to reduce the number of parameters in the weighting network, or using more efficient activation functions. Fourth, the authors should provide a more rigorous theoretical analysis of their method. This could involve deriving equations that describe the behavior of the global and local branches, and analyzing how the adaptive weighting mechanism affects the denoising process. Specifically, the authors should investigate the spectral properties of the diffusion operators at different scales, and how the proposed method balances the global and local feature representations. A theoretical analysis should also include a discussion of the stability and convergence properties of the proposed method. This would provide a deeper understanding of why the method works and how it compares to existing approaches. Finally, the authors should include a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed method. This should include an investigation into scenarios where the adaptive dual-scale approach might underperform or fail, such as datasets with highly irregular or fragmented structures. The authors should also explore the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameter settings, particularly those related to the adaptive weighting mechanism. This would provide a more balanced view of the method's capabilities and help guide future research. Furthermore, the authors should discuss the potential for overfitting, especially when dealing with small datasets, and explore techniques to mitigate this issue, such as data augmentation or regularization.",

The proposed method is simply using a larger learning rate for higher transformer layers, and the improvement is not significant. For example, the method only decreases the number of steps to reach 99% val accuracy from 4200 to 1923 for the mod division task, which I think neither fast nor significant, given that the total number of steps is 7500. Moreover, for the permutation task, the proposed method does not improve fast enough and still takes more than 5000 steps to reach 99% val accuracy, and the baseline method also requires almost the same number of steps (around 7500). I think the authors should either propose a more sophisticated method or present much more convincing experimental results to show that their method is effective.\n\n- The authors claim that their method can enhance generalization, but I do not see any evidence for this claim. I would expect that the proposed method would overfit very fast if it uses a larger learning rate for the higher layers. I suggest the authors present more evidence to support their claim.\n\n- The discussion about the theoretical understanding of the method is too brief and uninformative. I think the authors should either provide more insights into the method or just remove this part.\n\n- The claim that the proposed method can enhance grokking is not supported by any evidence. The claim that the method can improve generalization is also not supported by any evidence. I suggest the authors carefully revise these claims.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe core issue with this work is the lack of substantial evidence supporting the claims made about the proposed method. While the idea of using layer-specific learning rates is not novel, the authors fail to demonstrate a significant advantage of their particular configuration, especially in the context of grokking. The reported reduction in steps to reach 99% validation accuracy is marginal at best, and the method's performance on the permutation task is not compelling. To strengthen the paper, the authors should conduct more rigorous experiments, perhaps by testing on a wider range of tasks or by using more complex model architectures. Furthermore, they should provide a more detailed analysis of the training dynamics, showing how the layer-specific learning rates affect the learning process at different stages. This would help to understand why the proposed method is supposed to enhance grokking, rather than just stating it as a fact.\n\nTo address the concerns about generalization, the authors should include experiments that explicitly measure the generalization performance of their method. This could involve evaluating the model on unseen data or by using different train/test splits. It is crucial to show that the proposed method does not overfit the training data, especially given the use of higher learning rates in the later layers. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the loss landscape and how the layer-specific learning rates affect the optimization process. This could involve visualizing the loss surface or by analyzing the gradient norms for different layers. Such analysis would provide a deeper understanding of the method's behavior and help to justify the claims made about its effectiveness.\n\nFinally, the theoretical discussion needs to be significantly expanded. The current discussion is too high-level and does not provide any meaningful insights into the method. The authors should either provide a more detailed theoretical analysis of why their method works, or they should remove this section altogether. This analysis should include a discussion of the convergence properties of the method, as well as an explanation of how the layer-specific learning rates affect the generalization performance. Without a more rigorous theoretical foundation, the claims made in the paper remain unsubstantiated. The authors should also consider comparing their method to other existing techniques for improving generalization and grokking, to better position their work within the existing literature.\n\n### Questions\n\n- The authors claim that their method can enhance generalization, but I do not see any evidence for this claim. I would expect that the proposed method would overfit very fast if it uses a larger learning rate for the higher layers.

The authors demonstrate that using different learning rates for the embedding layer, lower Transformer layers, and higher Transformer layers significantly accelerates convergence and enhances grokking. The proposed method is evaluated on four tasks: modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n2\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.\n- The proposed method is straightforward and well-motivated.\n- The experimental results show that the method achieves substantial improvements over the baseline.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n - The novelty of the proposed method is limited, as layer-wise learning rates have been explored in previous works (e.g., Ko et al., 2022).\n- The experiments are conducted on a limited set of tasks, raising concerns about generalization to other tasks. Specifically, all tasks are algorithmic and relatively simple, which may not reflect the complexities of real-world applications. The lack of tasks involving sequential dependencies or natural language processing is a notable gap.\n- The analysis of the experimental results is insufficient. For instance, while the authors mention that the permutation task is more challenging, there is no detailed explanation of why this is the case from the model's perspective. A deeper analysis should include visualizations of attention patterns or layer activations to understand how the model learns these different tasks. Furthermore, the paper lacks a discussion on the sensitivity of the method to the specific learning rates chosen for each layer. It is unclear how these rates were determined and whether the results are robust to changes in these hyperparameters.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include a more diverse set of tasks. Specifically, they should consider tasks that involve sequential data, such as copying or reversing sequences, or tasks that require processing natural language. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's generalization capabilities. For example, the copy task, where the model must remember and reproduce a sequence of tokens, would test the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Similarly, tasks involving natural language, such as sentiment analysis or text classification, would demonstrate the method's applicability to more complex real-world scenarios. These additional tasks would help to address the concern that the current experiments are limited to simple algorithmic tasks.\n\nTo strengthen the analysis of the experimental results, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of why certain tasks are more challenging than others. For example, in the case of the permutation task, the authors should investigate the specific challenges that the model faces. This could involve visualizing the attention patterns of the model to see which parts of the input sequence are being attended to, or analyzing the activations of different layers to understand how the model is processing the input. Furthermore, the authors should conduct a sensitivity analysis of the learning rates. They should explore how the performance of the method changes when the learning rates for different layers are varied. This would provide insights into the robustness of the method and help to determine the optimal learning rates for different tasks. The authors should also provide a clear explanation of how the learning rates were initially chosen, whether through a grid search or some other method.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide a more thorough discussion of the limitations of their method. While the method shows promising results on the tasks considered, it is important to acknowledge its potential shortcomings. For example, the authors should discuss whether the method is likely to be effective on tasks with very different characteristics, such as those involving images or audio. They should also discuss the computational cost of the method and whether it is scalable to larger models and datasets. By addressing these limitations, the authors can provide a more balanced and realistic assessment of their work.\n\n### Questions\n\n- Can the authors provide more insights into why the permutation task is more challenging than the other tasks from the model's perspective?\n- How does the proposed method perform on tasks beyond algorithmic learning, such as language modeling or other real-world applications?\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 3\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes a layer-wise learning rate strategy for Transformer models to accelerate grokking in algorithmic learning tasks. The authors demonstrate that by assigning different learning rates to the embedding, lower, and higher layers of the Transformer, they can significantly improve convergence speed and final model performance on tasks such as modular arithmetic and permutations. The results show that the proposed method can reduce the time to achieve 99% validation accuracy by up to 60% while maintaining or improving final model accuracy.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3\n\n### Presentation\n\n3\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

The authors demonstrate that by carefully tuning the learning rates for different components of the Transformer model, they can significantly accelerate grokking and improve final model performance.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n - The experiments are conducted on a relatively small Transformer model with only two layers. It is unclear how the proposed method would perform on larger models with more layers, which are more commonly used in practice.\n- The paper does not provide a theoretical analysis of why the proposed layer-wise learning rate strategy works. While the empirical results are promising, a theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms would strengthen the paper's contribution.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper's exploration of layer-wise learning rates is promising, but its practical impact could be significantly enhanced by addressing the limitations of the experimental setup. Specifically, the use of a two-layer Transformer model raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings to more complex architectures. Future work should investigate the performance of the proposed method on models with a greater number of layers, varying the number of attention heads and the dimensionality of the hidden layers. This would provide a more robust assessment of the method's effectiveness and its potential for real-world applications. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore the sensitivity of the method to different model sizes and architectures, which could reveal optimal configurations for various tasks and datasets. Such an analysis would not only strengthen the empirical evidence but also provide valuable insights into the practical applicability of the proposed approach.\n\nWhile the empirical results are compelling, the lack of a theoretical framework limits the paper's contribution. A theoretical analysis could provide a deeper understanding of why different layers benefit from different learning rates, and how this relates to the optimization landscape of Transformer models. For instance, exploring the relationship between the layer-wise learning rates and the curvature of the loss function could offer valuable insights. Furthermore, investigating the connection between the proposed method and existing optimization techniques, such as adaptive learning rate methods, could help to contextualize the findings and identify potential avenues for further improvement. A theoretical analysis could also help to determine the optimal learning rate schedule for each layer, which could lead to even better performance. Without a theoretical foundation, the proposed method remains somewhat ad-hoc, and its long-term impact is limited.\n\nFinally, the paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed method. For example, it would be useful to explore the computational overhead of the layer-wise learning rate strategy, and whether it introduces any additional challenges in terms of hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, it would be valuable to investigate the robustness of the method to different datasets and tasks, and to identify any potential failure modes. A thorough discussion of these limitations would provide a more balanced perspective on the proposed approach and help to guide future research in this area. This would also help to clarify the scope of the method and its potential for broader adoption.\n\n### Questions\n\n- How does the proposed method perform on larger Transformer models with more layers?\n- Is there any theoretical justification for why different layers should have different learning rates?\n\n### Rating\n\n5\n\n### Confidence\n\n3\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 4\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes a layer-wise learning rate strategy to accelerate grokking in Transformer models for algorithmic learning tasks. The authors observe that different layers in Transformers learn at different rates and contribute differently to the grokking process. By assigning distinct learning rates to the embedding layers, lower Transformer layers, and higher Transformer layers, they aim to optimize the learning dynamics and facilitate faster generalization. The method is validated on tasks like modular arithmetic and permutations, showing significant improvements in convergence speed and final performance compared to a baseline with uniform learning rates.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3\n\n### Presentation\n\n3\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the methodology and results.\n2. The proposed layer-wise learning rate strategy is straightforward to implement and shows promising results on the tested tasks.\n3. The empirical findings are interesting, demonstrating that different layers in Transformers contribute differently to the grokking phenomenon.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The experiments are conducted on relatively simple tasks and a small Transformer model. It is unclear how the method would scale to more complex tasks or larger models. Specifically, the modular arithmetic and permutation tasks, while useful for initial validation, do not fully capture the complexities of real-world algorithmic learning scenarios. The limited scale of the Transformer model (e.g., number of layers, hidden dimensions) raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings to more substantial architectures.\n2. The paper lacks a theoretical analysis of why the proposed method works. While the empirical results are promising, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms would strengthen the contribution. The paper does not provide any formal justification for why different learning rates for different layers should lead to faster grokking. It remains unclear what specific properties of the loss landscape or the optimization process are being exploited by this approach.\n3. The comparison is primarily with a uniform learning rate baseline. It would be beneficial to compare with other existing methods for improving grokking or generalization in Transformers. The absence of comparisons with other established techniques makes it difficult to assess the relative effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, techniques like curriculum learning or specific regularization methods could serve as relevant baselines.\n4. The paper does not explore the sensitivity of the method to the choice of learning rates for different layers. It is unclear how to determine the optimal learning rates for a given task or model. The paper provides no guidance on how to select the learning rates for each layer, which is a critical practical concern. Without a systematic approach to learning rate selection, the method's applicability is limited.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit significantly from a more thorough exploration of the method's scalability. The authors should consider evaluating their approach on more complex algorithmic tasks, such as those involving recursive functions or dynamic programming, which would provide a more rigorous test of the method's capabilities. Furthermore, experiments should be conducted using larger Transformer models with varying depths and widths to assess how the layer-wise learning rate strategy performs under different architectural configurations. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's robustness and generalizability. It would also be beneficial to investigate the impact of different initialization schemes on the effectiveness of the proposed learning rate strategy, as this could interact with the layer-wise learning rates.\n\nTo strengthen the theoretical foundation of the work, the authors should attempt to provide some analysis of why their method works. This could involve analyzing the gradients of different layers during training to understand how the layer-wise learning rates affect the optimization process. For example, visualizing the magnitude and direction of gradients in different layers could provide insights into how the learning rates are influencing the learning dynamics. Furthermore, the authors could explore the relationship between the learning rates and the loss landscape, perhaps by analyzing the Hessian of the loss function. This could help to explain why the proposed learning rate strategy leads to faster convergence and better generalization. A theoretical analysis, even if not fully rigorous, would greatly enhance the paper's contribution.\n\nFinally, the paper needs a more comprehensive experimental evaluation. The authors should compare their method against other existing techniques for improving grokking, such as curriculum learning, or specific regularization methods. This would provide a better understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the learning rates is crucial. The authors should explore how the performance of the method varies with different learning rate configurations and provide some guidelines for selecting appropriate learning rates for different tasks and models. This could involve a grid search or a more sophisticated hyperparameter optimization technique. Without such an analysis, the practical applicability of the method is limited.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. How does the method perform on more complex tasks or larger Transformer models?\n2. Is there any theoretical justification for why different layers should have different learning rates?\n3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of learning rates for different layers?

For example, the method only decreases the number of steps to reach 99% val accuracy from 4200 to 1923 for the mod division task, which I think neither fast nor significant, given that the total number of steps is 7500. Moreover, for the permutation task, the proposed method does not improve fast enough and still takes more than 5000 steps to reach 99% val accuracy, and the baseline method also requires almost the same number of steps (around 7500). I think the authors should either propose a more sophisticated method or present much more convincing experimental results to show that their method is effective.\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\n    a) Method-related Evidence: The method description in Section 4 clearly states the use of different learning rates for different layers. The example provided in the \"Method\" section of the prompt also confirms this: \"For example, in a Transformer model with two layers, a dimension of 128, and 4 attention heads, the embedding layers might be assigned a learning rate of 8e-4, the lower Transformer layers a learning rate of 2e-3, and the higher Transformer layers a learning rate of 3e-3.\" The paper explicitly mentions assigning a higher learning rate to the higher Transformer layers.\n    b) Experiment-related Evidence: Table 1 in the \"Results\" section provides the data the reviewer is referring to:\n        * Mod Division: Baseline Steps to 99% Val Acc = 4200.0, Ours Steps to 99% Val Acc = 1923.3\n        * Permutation: Baseline Steps to 99% Val Acc = 7500.0*, Ours Steps to 99% Val Acc = 5270.0. The asterisk indicates the baseline did not reach 99% within 7500 steps.\n\n3. Literature Gap Analysis: Not applicable for this weakness.\n\n4. Validation Analysis:\n    * Primary evidence summary: The paper explicitly describes the method as using different learning rates for different layers, including a higher rate for higher layers. The experimental results in Table 1 show the specific numbers the reviewer uses to argue that the improvement is not significant enough.\n    * Supporting quotes:\n        * Method: \"Our approach is based on the following key assumptions: - The optimal learning rates for different layers may vary significantly.\" and \"Each group is assigned a different learning rate: _η_ _e_, _η_ _l_, and _η_ _h_ respectively.\"\n        * Results (Table 1): The table directly presents the \"Steps to 99% Val Acc\" for both the baseline and the proposed method for the mentioned tasks.\n    * Impact assessment: The reviewer's assessment of the significance of the results is subjective. While the reduction in steps for Mod Division is substantial (almost 54%), the reviewer finds it not \"fast nor significant\". The reviewer correctly points out that the Permutation task still takes a considerable number of steps for the proposed method.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n    * Validity status: Partially Valid. The reviewer accurately describes the method and the experimental results. The assessment of the significance of the results is subjective.\n    * Confidence level: High\n    * Key supporting evidence: Method description, Table 1 data.\n\n1. Weakness Statement: The authors claim that their method can enhance generalization, but I do not see any evidence for this claim. I would expect that the proposed method would overfit very fast if it uses a larger learning rate for the higher layers. I suggest the authors present more evidence to support their claim.\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\n    a) Method-related Evidence: The \"Motivation\" section states: \"This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing a layer-wise learning rate strategy that accelerates and enhances grokking in Transformer models.\" The \"Main Idea\" section mentions: \"This approach not only accelerates the convergence of the model but also enhances its final performance and generalization capabilities.\"\n    b) Experiment-related Evidence: The \"Metrics\" section lists \"Final training and validation accuracy\" and \"Final training and validation loss\" as evaluation metrics. Table 1 shows the \"Final Val Acc\" and \"Final Val Loss\" for both the baseline and the proposed method. For example, in the Permutation task, the proposed method achieves a significantly higher final validation accuracy (0.9995) and a lower final validation loss (0.0106) compared to the baseline (0.0359 and 6.8042, respectively).\n\n3.

The experimental results, particularly the final validation accuracy and loss, are presented as evidence for this claim.\n    * Supporting quotes:\n        * Motivation: \"This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing a layer-wise learning rate strategy that accelerates and enhances grokking in Transformer models.\"\n        * Main Idea: \"This approach not only accelerates the convergence of the model but also enhances its final performance and generalization capabilities.\"\n        * Results (Table 1): The table shows improved final validation accuracy and lower final validation loss for the proposed method in several tasks, including the challenging Permutation task.\n    * Impact assessment: The reviewer's expectation of overfitting is contradicted by the experimental results showing improved validation accuracy and lower validation loss, which are indicators of better generalization.\n\n5.

I think the authors should either provide more insights into the method or just remove this part.\n\n2. Evidence Collection:\n    a) Method-related Evidence: The \"Rationale\" section within the \"Method\" section provides a brief explanation: \"The rationale behind this approach is that different components of the model may benefit from different learning dynamics. Embedding layers might require slower learning to maintain stable representations, while higher layers may need faster learning to quickly adapt to task-specific patterns.\"\n    b) Experiment-related Evidence: Not applicable for this weakness.\n    c) Literature Gap Analysis: The \"Discussion and Limitations\" section mentions: \"The success of our approach suggests that different layers in the Transformer contribute differently to the grokking process. The embedding layers, which learn fundamental representations of the input tokens, appear to benefit from slower learning rates that allow for stable feature development. In contrast, higher layers that perform more task-specific computations may require faster adaptation. This aligns with observations in Ko et al. (2022) about differential learning needs across network depths. However, a more rigorous theoretical analysis of how these learning dynamics interact with grokking remains an important area for future work.\"\n\n3.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a layer-wise learning rate strategy for Transformer models, aiming to accelerate the phenomenon of grokking in algorithmic learning tasks. The core idea is that different layers in a Transformer model learn at different rates and contribute differently to the grokking process. To leverage this, the authors propose assigning distinct learning rates to the embedding layers, lower Transformer layers, and higher Transformer layers. Specifically, they implement a configuration where the embedding layers are assigned a learning rate of 8e-4, the lower Transformer layers a learning rate of 2e-3, and the higher Transformer layers a learning rate of 3e-3. The method is evaluated on four tasks: modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation, all using a two-layer Transformer model with a hidden dimension of 128 and 4 attention heads. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed layer-wise learning rate strategy significantly reduces the number of steps required to reach 99% validation accuracy compared to a baseline with a uniform learning rate. For instance, in the modular division task, the proposed method achieves 99% validation accuracy in 1923 steps, while the baseline requires 4200 steps. Similarly, in the permutation task, the proposed method reaches 99% validation accuracy in 5270 steps, whereas the baseline does not reach this threshold within 7500 steps. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves higher final validation accuracy and lower final validation loss in most tasks. The authors argue that their approach not only accelerates convergence but also enhances the model's generalization capabilities. While the paper provides empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed method, it lacks a deep theoretical analysis of why the method works and does not explore the sensitivity of the method to the specific learning rates chosen for each layer. The paper also acknowledges that the experiments are conducted on a relatively small Transformer model and a limited set of algorithmic tasks, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings to more complex models and real-world applications. Despite these limitations, the paper presents a simple yet effective approach to accelerate grokking in Transformer models, which could be a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nOne of the primary strengths of this paper lies in its clear and concise presentation of the proposed method. The authors articulate their motivation, methodology, and experimental setup in a way that is easy to follow, making the paper accessible to a broad audience. The core idea of using layer-wise learning rates is straightforward and well-motivated, building on the intuition that different layers in a Transformer model learn at different rates and contribute differently to the grokking process. The empirical findings are also compelling, demonstrating that the proposed method significantly accelerates convergence and improves final model performance on the tested algorithmic tasks. For example, the reduction in steps to reach 99% validation accuracy in the modular division task is substantial, and the improvement in the permutation task is particularly noteworthy, given its complexity. The paper also provides evidence that the proposed method enhances generalization, as indicated by the improved final validation accuracy and lower final validation loss compared to the baseline. The ablation study, while not exhaustive, provides valuable insights into the importance of each component of the proposed method. Furthermore, the paper acknowledges the limitations of the study and suggests future research directions, which demonstrates a thoughtful and critical approach to the research. The simplicity of the proposed method is also a strength, as it is easy to implement and could be readily adopted in practice. The authors have successfully demonstrated that a simple modification to the learning rate schedule can lead to significant improvements in the training of Transformer models, which is a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, several weaknesses warrant careful consideration. First, the novelty of the proposed method is limited. While the authors apply layer-wise learning rates to the specific context of grokking in Transformers, the core idea of using different learning rates for different layers has been explored in previous works, as acknowledged in the 'Related Work' section. The paper cites Ko et al. (2022) as an example of prior work in this area. This lack of novelty reduces the overall impact of the paper. Second, the experimental evaluation is limited in scope. The experiments are conducted on a relatively small Transformer model with only two layers, as explicitly stated in the 'Model Architecture' section. It is unclear how the proposed method would perform on larger models with more layers, which are more commonly used in practice. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings to more complex architectures. Furthermore, the experiments are limited to a small set of algorithmic tasks, including modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation. These tasks, while useful for initial validation, do not fully capture the complexities of real-world applications. The lack of tasks involving sequential dependencies or natural language processing is a notable gap. This limited task diversity raises concerns about the method's applicability to more complex problems. Third, the analysis of the experimental results is insufficient. While the authors mention that the permutation task is more challenging, there is no detailed explanation of why this is the case from the model's perspective. A deeper analysis should include visualizations of attention patterns or layer activations to understand how the model learns these different tasks. The paper also lacks a discussion on the sensitivity of the method to the specific learning rates chosen for each layer. It is unclear how these rates were determined and whether the results are robust to changes in these hyperparameters. The 'Implementation Details' section mentions that multiple runs were conducted with different learning rate configurations, but a systematic sensitivity analysis is missing. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the method and to provide guidance on how to select appropriate learning rates for different tasks and models. Fourth, the paper lacks a theoretical analysis of why the proposed method works. While the empirical results are promising, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms would strengthen the paper's contribution. The 'Rationale' section provides a brief intuitive explanation, but it does not offer a formal justification for why different learning rates for different layers should lead to faster grokking. It remains unclear what specific properties of the loss landscape or the optimization process are being exploited by this approach. The 'Discussion and Limitations' section acknowledges this gap and suggests future work, but the absence of a theoretical framework limits the paper's contribution. Finally, the comparison is primarily with a uniform learning rate baseline. It would be beneficial to compare with other existing methods for improving grokking or generalization in Transformers. The absence of comparisons with other established techniques makes it difficult to assess the relative effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, techniques like curriculum learning or specific regularization methods could serve as relevant baselines. The 'Baseline Comparison' section explicitly states that the method is compared against a baseline uniform learning rate strategy, highlighting the lack of comparison with other methods. These weaknesses, taken together, limit the overall impact and generalizability of the paper's findings. My confidence in these limitations is high, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and experimental setup.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include a more diverse set of tasks. Specifically, they should consider tasks that involve sequential data, such as copying or reversing sequences, or tasks that require processing natural language. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's generalization capabilities. For example, the copy task, where the model must remember and reproduce a sequence of tokens, would test the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Similarly, tasks involving natural language, such as sentiment analysis or text classification, would demonstrate the method's applicability to more complex real-world scenarios. These additional tasks would help to address the concern that the current experiments are limited to simple algorithmic tasks. Second, the authors should investigate the performance of the proposed method on larger Transformer models with more layers. This would provide a more robust assessment of the method's effectiveness and its potential for real-world applications. Future work should investigate the performance of the proposed method on models with a greater number of layers, varying the number of attention heads and the dimensionality of the hidden layers. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's robustness and generalizability. It would also be beneficial to investigate the impact of different initialization schemes on the effectiveness of the proposed learning rate strategy, as this could interact with the layer-wise learning rates. Third, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the experimental results. This should include visualizations of attention patterns and layer activations to understand how the model learns different tasks. For example, in the case of the permutation task, the authors should investigate the specific challenges that the model faces. Furthermore, the authors should conduct a sensitivity analysis of the learning rates. They should explore how the performance of the method changes when the learning rates for different layers are varied. This would provide insights into the robustness of the method and help to determine the optimal learning rates for different tasks. The authors should also provide a clear explanation of how the learning rates were initially chosen, whether through a grid search or some other method. Fourth, the authors should attempt to provide some theoretical analysis of why their method works. This could involve analyzing the gradients of different layers during training to understand how the layer-wise learning rates affect the optimization process. For example, visualizing the magnitude and direction of gradients in different layers could provide insights into how the learning rates are influencing the learning dynamics. Furthermore, the authors could explore the relationship between the learning rates and the loss landscape, perhaps by analyzing the Hessian of the loss function. This could help to explain why the proposed learning rate strategy leads to faster convergence and better generalization. A theoretical analysis, even if not fully rigorous, would greatly enhance the paper's contribution. Finally, the authors should compare their method against other existing techniques for improving grokking, such as curriculum learning, or specific regularization methods. This would provide a better understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach. These suggestions, if implemented, would significantly strengthen the paper and address the identified weaknesses.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nSeveral questions arise from my analysis of this paper. First, how does the proposed method perform on more complex tasks or larger Transformer models? The current experiments are limited to simple algorithmic tasks and a two-layer Transformer model. It is unclear whether the method would be effective on tasks with more complex data or on models with more layers, attention heads, or larger hidden dimensions. Second, is there any theoretical justification for why different layers should have different learning rates? The paper provides an intuitive explanation, but it lacks a formal theoretical analysis of why this approach works. What specific properties of the loss landscape or the optimization process are being exploited by this approach? Third, how sensitive is the method to the choice of learning rates for different layers? The paper mentions that multiple runs were conducted with different learning rate configurations, but it does not provide a systematic sensitivity analysis. How does the performance of the method vary with different learning rate configurations, and is there a systematic way to determine the optimal learning rates for a given task or model? Fourth, what are the computational costs of the proposed method compared to other existing techniques for improving grokking or generalization in Transformers? Does the method introduce any additional challenges in terms of hyperparameter tuning? Finally, what are the limitations of the proposed method, and under what conditions is it likely to be effective or ineffective? Are there any potential failure modes, and how can these be mitigated? These questions highlight key uncertainties and areas for further investigation, which would help to better understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed method.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n4.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}",

The proposed method is simply using a larger learning rate for higher transformer layers, and the improvement is not significant. For example, the method only decreases the number of steps to reach 99% val accuracy from 4200 to 1923 for the mod division task, which I think neither fast nor significant, given that the total number of steps is 7500. Moreover, for the permutation task, the proposed method does not improve fast enough and still takes more than 5000 steps to reach 99% val accuracy, and the baseline method also requires almost the same number of steps (around 7500). I think the authors should either propose a more sophisticated method or present much more convincing experimental results to show that their method is effective.\n\n- The authors claim that their method can enhance generalization, but I do not see any evidence for this claim. I would expect that the proposed method would overfit very fast if it uses a larger learning rate for the higher layers. I suggest the authors present more evidence to support their claim.\n\n- The discussion about the theoretical understanding of the method is too brief and uninformative. I think the authors should either provide more insights into the method or just remove this part.\n\n- The claim that the proposed method can enhance grokking is not supported by any evidence. The claim that the method can improve generalization is also not supported by any evidence. I suggest the authors carefully revise these claims.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe core issue with this work is the lack of substantial evidence supporting the claims made about the proposed method. While the idea of using layer-specific learning rates is not novel, the authors fail to demonstrate a significant advantage of their particular configuration, especially in the context of grokking. The reported reduction in steps to reach 99% validation accuracy is marginal at best, and the method's performance on the permutation task is not compelling. To strengthen the paper, the authors should conduct more rigorous experiments, perhaps by testing on a wider range of tasks or by using more complex model architectures. Furthermore, they should provide a more detailed analysis of the training dynamics, showing how the layer-specific learning rates affect the learning process at different stages. This would help to understand why the proposed method is supposed to enhance grokking, rather than just stating it as a fact.\n\nTo address the concerns about generalization, the authors should include experiments that explicitly measure the generalization performance of their method. This could involve evaluating the model on unseen data or by using different train/test splits. It is crucial to show that the proposed method does not overfit the training data, especially given the use of higher learning rates in the later layers. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the loss landscape and how the layer-specific learning rates affect the optimization process. This could involve visualizing the loss surface or by analyzing the gradient norms for different layers. Such analysis would provide a deeper understanding of the method's behavior and help to justify the claims made about its effectiveness.\n\nFinally, the theoretical discussion needs to be significantly expanded. The current discussion is too high-level and does not provide any meaningful insights into the method. The authors should either provide a more detailed theoretical analysis of why their method works, or they should remove this section altogether. This analysis should include a discussion of the convergence properties of the method, as well as an explanation of how the layer-specific learning rates affect the generalization performance. Without a more rigorous theoretical foundation, the claims made in the paper remain unsubstantiated. The authors should also consider comparing their method to other existing techniques for improving generalization and grokking, to better position their work within the existing literature.\n\n### Questions\n\n- The authors claim that their method can enhance generalization, but I do not see any evidence for this claim. I would expect that the proposed method would overfit very fast if it uses a larger learning rate for the higher layers.

While the method shows promising results on the tasks considered, it is important to acknowledge its potential shortcomings. For example, the authors should discuss whether the method is likely to be effective on tasks with very different characteristics, such as those involving images or audio. They should also discuss the computational cost of the method and whether it is scalable to larger models and datasets.

                "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces a layer-wise learning rate strategy for Transformer models, aiming to accelerate the phenomenon of grokking in algorithmic learning tasks. The core idea is that different layers in a Transformer model learn at different rates and contribute differently to the grokking process. To leverage this, the authors propose assigning distinct learning rates to the embedding layers, lower Transformer layers, and higher Transformer layers. Specifically, they implement a configuration where the embedding layers are assigned a learning rate of 8e-4, the lower Transformer layers a learning rate of 2e-3, and the higher Transformer layers a learning rate of 3e-3. The method is evaluated on four tasks: modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation, all using a two-layer Transformer model with a hidden dimension of 128 and 4 attention heads. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed layer-wise learning rate strategy significantly reduces the number of steps required to reach 99% validation accuracy compared to a baseline with a uniform learning rate. For instance, in the modular division task, the proposed method achieves 99% validation accuracy in 1923 steps, while the baseline requires 4200 steps. Similarly, in the permutation task, the proposed method reaches 99% validation accuracy in 5270 steps, whereas the baseline does not reach this threshold within 7500 steps. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves higher final validation accuracy and lower final validation loss in most tasks. The authors argue that their approach not only accelerates convergence but also enhances the model's generalization capabilities. While the paper provides empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed method, it lacks a deep theoretical analysis of why the method works and does not explore the sensitivity of the method to the specific learning rates chosen for each layer. The paper also acknowledges that the experiments are conducted on a relatively small Transformer model and a limited set of algorithmic tasks, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings to more complex models and real-world applications. Despite these limitations, the paper presents a simple yet effective approach to accelerate grokking in Transformer models, which could be a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nOne of the primary strengths of this paper lies in its clear and concise presentation of the proposed method. The authors articulate their motivation, methodology, and experimental setup in a way that is easy to follow, making the paper accessible to a broad audience. The core idea of using layer-wise learning rates is straightforward and well-motivated, building on the intuition that different layers in a Transformer model learn at different rates and contribute differently to the grokking process. The empirical findings are also compelling, demonstrating that the proposed method significantly accelerates convergence and improves final model performance on the tested algorithmic tasks. For example, the reduction in steps to reach 99% validation accuracy in the modular division task is substantial, and the improvement in the permutation task is particularly noteworthy, given its complexity. The paper also provides evidence that the proposed method enhances generalization, as indicated by the improved final validation accuracy and lower final validation loss compared to the baseline. The ablation study, while not exhaustive, provides valuable insights into the importance of each component of the proposed method. Furthermore, the paper acknowledges the limitations of the study and suggests future research directions, which demonstrates a thoughtful and critical approach to the research. The simplicity of the proposed method is also a strength, as it is easy to implement and could be readily adopted in practice. The authors have successfully demonstrated that a simple modification to the learning rate schedule can lead to significant improvements in the training of Transformer models, which is a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, several weaknesses warrant careful consideration. First, the novelty of the proposed method is limited. While the authors apply layer-wise learning rates to the specific context of grokking in Transformers, the core idea of using different learning rates for different layers has been explored in previous works, as acknowledged in the 'Related Work' section. The paper cites Ko et al. (2022) as an example of prior work in this area. This lack of novelty reduces the overall impact of the paper. Second, the experimental evaluation is limited in scope. The experiments are conducted on a relatively small Transformer model with only two layers, as explicitly stated in the 'Model Architecture' section. It is unclear how the proposed method would perform on larger models with more layers, which are more commonly used in practice. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings to more complex architectures. Furthermore, the experiments are limited to a small set of algorithmic tasks, including modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation. These tasks, while useful for initial validation, do not fully capture the complexities of real-world applications. The lack of tasks involving sequential dependencies or natural language processing is a notable gap. This limited task diversity raises concerns about the method's applicability to more complex problems. Third, the analysis of the experimental results is insufficient. While the authors mention that the permutation task is more challenging, there is no detailed explanation of why this is the case from the model's perspective. A deeper analysis should include visualizations of attention patterns or layer activations to understand how the model learns these different tasks. The paper also lacks a discussion on the sensitivity of the method to the specific learning rates chosen for each layer. It is unclear how these rates were determined and whether the results are robust to changes in these hyperparameters. The 'Implementation Details' section mentions that multiple runs were conducted with different learning rate configurations, but a systematic sensitivity analysis is missing. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the method and to provide guidance on how to select appropriate learning rates for different tasks and models. Fourth, the paper lacks a theoretical analysis of why the proposed method works. While the empirical results are promising, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms would strengthen the paper's contribution. The 'Rationale' section provides a brief intuitive explanation, but it does not offer a formal justification for why different learning rates for different layers should lead to faster grokking. It remains unclear what specific properties of the loss landscape or the optimization process are being exploited by this approach. The 'Discussion and Limitations' section acknowledges this gap and suggests future work, but the absence of a theoretical framework limits the paper's contribution. Finally, the comparison is primarily with a uniform learning rate baseline. It would be beneficial to compare with other existing methods for improving grokking or generalization in Transformers. The absence of comparisons with other established techniques makes it difficult to assess the relative effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, techniques like curriculum learning or specific regularization methods could serve as relevant baselines. The 'Baseline Comparison' section explicitly states that the method is compared against a baseline uniform learning rate strategy, highlighting the lack of comparison with other methods. These weaknesses, taken together, limit the overall impact and generalizability of the paper's findings. My confidence in these limitations is high, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and experimental setup.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include a more diverse set of tasks. Specifically, they should consider tasks that involve sequential data, such as copying or reversing sequences, or tasks that require processing natural language. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's generalization capabilities. For example, the copy task, where the model must remember and reproduce a sequence of tokens, would test the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Similarly, tasks involving natural language, such as sentiment analysis or text classification, would demonstrate the method's applicability to more complex real-world scenarios. These additional tasks would help to address the concern that the current experiments are limited to simple algorithmic tasks. Second, the authors should investigate the performance of the proposed method on larger Transformer models with more layers. This would provide a more robust assessment of the method's effectiveness and its potential for real-world applications. Future work should investigate the performance of the proposed method on models with a greater number of layers, varying the number of attention heads and the dimensionality of the hidden layers. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's robustness and generalizability. It would also be beneficial to investigate the impact of different initialization schemes on the effectiveness of the proposed learning rate strategy, as this could interact with the layer-wise learning rates. Third, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the experimental results. This should include visualizations of attention patterns and layer activations to understand how the model learns different tasks. For example, in the case of the permutation task, the authors should investigate the specific challenges that the model faces. Furthermore, the authors should conduct a sensitivity analysis of the learning rates. They should explore how the performance of the method changes when the learning rates for different layers are varied. This would provide insights into the robustness of the method and help to determine the optimal learning rates for different tasks. The authors should also provide a clear explanation of how the learning rates were initially chosen, whether through a grid search or some other method.

This would provide a better understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach. These suggestions, if implemented, would significantly strengthen the paper and address the identified weaknesses.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nSeveral questions arise from my analysis of this paper. First, how does the proposed method perform on more complex tasks or larger Transformer models? The current experiments are limited to simple algorithmic tasks and a two-layer Transformer model. It is unclear whether the method would be effective on tasks with more complex data or on models with more layers, attention heads, or larger hidden dimensions.

Does the method introduce any additional challenges in terms of hyperparameter tuning? Finally, what are the limitations of the proposed method, and under what conditions is it likely to be effective or ineffective? Are there any potential failure modes, and how can these be mitigated? These questions highlight key uncertainties and areas for further investigation, which would help to better understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed method.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n4.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject",

Specifically, they implement a configuration where the embedding layers are assigned a learning rate of 8e-4, the lower Transformer layers a learning rate of 2e-3, and the higher Transformer layers a learning rate of 3e-3. The method is evaluated on four tasks: modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation, all using a two-layer Transformer model with a hidden dimension of 128 and 4 attention heads. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed layer-wise learning rate strategy significantly reduces the number of steps required to reach 99% validation accuracy compared to a baseline with a uniform learning rate. For instance, in the modular division task, the proposed method achieves 99% validation accuracy in 1923 steps, while the baseline requires 4200 steps. Similarly, in the permutation task, the proposed method reaches 99% validation accuracy in 5270 steps, whereas the baseline does not reach this threshold within 7500 steps. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves higher final validation accuracy and lower final validation loss in most tasks. The authors argue that their approach not only accelerates convergence but also enhances the model's generalization capabilities. While the paper provides empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed method, it lacks a deep theoretical analysis of why the method works and does not explore the sensitivity of the method to the specific learning rates chosen for each layer. The paper also acknowledges that the experiments are conducted on a relatively small Transformer model and a limited set of algorithmic tasks, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings to more complex models and real-world applications. Despite these limitations, the paper presents a simple yet effective approach to accelerate grokking in Transformer models, which could be a valuable contribution to the field.",

                "strengths": "One of the primary strengths of this paper lies in its clear and concise presentation of the proposed method. The authors articulate their motivation, methodology, and experimental setup in a way that is easy to follow, making the paper accessible to a broad audience. The core idea of using layer-wise learning rates is straightforward and well-motivated, building on the intuition that different layers in a Transformer model learn at different rates and contribute differently to the grokking process. The empirical findings are also compelling, demonstrating that the proposed method significantly accelerates convergence and improves final model performance on the tested algorithmic tasks. For example, the reduction in steps to reach 99% validation accuracy in the modular division task is substantial, and the improvement in the permutation task is particularly noteworthy, given its complexity. The paper also provides evidence that the proposed method enhances generalization, as indicated by the improved final validation accuracy and lower final validation loss compared to the baseline. The ablation study, while not exhaustive, provides valuable insights into the importance of each component of the proposed method. Furthermore, the paper acknowledges the limitations of the study and suggests future research directions, which demonstrates a thoughtful and critical approach to the research. The simplicity of the proposed method is also a strength, as it is easy to implement and could be readily adopted in practice. The authors have successfully demonstrated that a simple modification to the learning rate schedule can lead to significant improvements in the training of Transformer models, which is a valuable contribution to the field.",
                "weaknesses": "Despite the strengths of this paper, several weaknesses warrant careful consideration. First, the novelty of the proposed method is limited. While the authors apply layer-wise learning rates to the specific context of grokking in Transformers, the core idea of using different learning rates for different layers has been explored in previous works, as acknowledged in the 'Related Work' section. The paper cites Ko et al. (2022) as an example of prior work in this area. This lack of novelty reduces the overall impact of the paper. Second, the experimental evaluation is limited in scope. The experiments are conducted on a relatively small Transformer model with only two layers, as explicitly stated in the 'Model Architecture' section. It is unclear how the proposed method would perform on larger models with more layers, which are more commonly used in practice. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings to more complex architectures. Furthermore, the experiments are limited to a small set of algorithmic tasks, including modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation. These tasks, while useful for initial validation, do not fully capture the complexities of real-world applications. The lack of tasks involving sequential dependencies or natural language processing is a notable gap. This limited task diversity raises concerns about the method's applicability to more complex problems. Third, the analysis of the experimental results is insufficient. While the authors mention that the permutation task is more challenging, there is no detailed explanation of why this is the case from the model's perspective. A deeper analysis should include visualizations of attention patterns or layer activations to understand how the model learns these different tasks. The paper also lacks a discussion on the sensitivity of the method to the specific learning rates chosen for each layer. It is unclear how these rates were determined and whether the results are robust to changes in these hyperparameters. The 'Implementation Details' section mentions that multiple runs were conducted with different learning rate configurations, but a systematic sensitivity analysis is missing. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the method and to provide guidance on how to select appropriate learning rates for different tasks and models. Fourth, the paper lacks a theoretical analysis of why the proposed method works. While the empirical results are promising, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms would strengthen the paper's contribution. The 'Rationale' section provides a brief intuitive explanation, but it does not offer a formal justification for why different learning rates for different layers should lead to faster grokking. It remains unclear what specific properties of the loss landscape or the optimization process are being exploited by this approach. The 'Discussion and Limitations' section acknowledges this gap and suggests future work, but the absence of a theoretical framework limits the paper's contribution. Finally, the comparison is primarily with a uniform learning rate baseline. It would be beneficial to compare with other existing methods for improving grokking or generalization in Transformers. The absence of comparisons with other established techniques makes it difficult to assess the relative effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, techniques like curriculum learning or specific regularization methods could serve as relevant baselines. The 'Baseline Comparison' section explicitly states that the method is compared against a baseline uniform learning rate strategy, highlighting the lack of comparison with other methods. These weaknesses, taken together, limit the overall impact and generalizability of the paper's findings. My confidence in these limitations is high, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and experimental setup.",
                "suggestions": "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include a more diverse set of tasks. Specifically, they should consider tasks that involve sequential data, such as copying or reversing sequences, or tasks that require processing natural language. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's generalization capabilities. For example, the copy task, where the model must remember and reproduce a sequence of tokens, would test the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Similarly, tasks involving natural language, such as sentiment analysis or text classification, would demonstrate the method's applicability to more complex real-world scenarios. These additional tasks would help to address the concern that the current experiments are limited to simple algorithmic tasks. Second, the authors should investigate the performance of the proposed method on larger Transformer models with more layers. This would provide a more robust assessment of the method's effectiveness and its potential for real-world applications. Future work should investigate the performance of the proposed method on models with a greater number of layers, varying the number of attention heads and the dimensionality of the hidden layers. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's robustness and generalizability. It would also be beneficial to investigate the impact of different initialization schemes on the effectiveness of the proposed learning rate strategy, as this could interact with the layer-wise learning rates. Third, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the experimental results. This should include visualizations of attention patterns and layer activations to understand how the model learns different tasks. For example, in the case of the permutation task, the authors should investigate the specific challenges that the model faces. Furthermore, the authors should conduct a sensitivity analysis of the learning rates. They should explore how the performance of the method changes when the learning rates for different layers are varied. This would provide insights into the robustness of the method and help to determine the optimal learning rates for different tasks. The authors should also provide a clear explanation of how the learning rates were initially chosen, whether through a grid search or some other method. Fourth, the authors should attempt to provide some theoretical analysis of why their method works. This could involve analyzing the gradients of different layers during training to understand how the layer-wise learning rates affect the optimization process. For example, visualizing the magnitude and direction of gradients in different layers could provide insights into how the learning rates are influencing the learning dynamics. Furthermore, the authors could explore the relationship between the learning rates and the loss landscape, perhaps by analyzing the Hessian of the loss function. This could help to explain why the proposed learning rate strategy leads to faster convergence and better generalization. A theoretical analysis, even if not fully rigorous, would greatly enhance the paper's contribution. Finally, the authors should compare their method against other existing techniques for improving grokking, such as curriculum learning, or specific regularization methods. This would provide a better understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach. These suggestions, if implemented, would significantly strengthen the paper and address the identified weaknesses.",
